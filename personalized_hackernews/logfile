                'then convert it back to a double precision value. Weird!',

                'back in the days before ',
                '. The asm.js people were porting C code to JavaScript, and '
                "the weird casting performed by JavaScript's weird bitwise "
                "operators was just what they needed to emulate C's integer "

                ' and ',
                ' are integers then ',
                ' will do integer division, rounding the result down. In '
                'JavaScript ',
                ' will always be a floating point division with a floating '
                'point result. But if you apply a bitwise operator right '
                'afterward, then the result will be rounded down, converted to '
                "integer, and you'll get the same number as C did! With a lot "
                "more work. Of course you don't want your bitwise operator to "

                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',
                ' after your arithmetic operations, and for unsigned you use ',
                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '

                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',

                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "
                'so bad, because CPUs add 32-bit numbers just as fast as 8-bit '
                'numbers. Where smaller types ',
                ' matter is in memory usage. If you want an array of bytes, '
                'but you use a JavaScript array to store JavaScript numbers '
                'instead, it will use 8 times the memory (and 8 times the '
                'memory bandwidth, and 8 times the cache space) because every '

                'solution for this too: typed arrays. Typed arrays can hold '
                '8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values in both signed and unsigned '
                "varieties. As an added benefit, since typed arrays can't hold "

                'sectors (beyond burger for highly processed food). These '

                ' consumption (horizontal axis) and annual ',
                ' cost (vertical axis). On the far right we have water, which '

                'anything else. As we trend to the left, we traverse steadily '
                'more sophisticated products with higher unit costs and lower '
                'production volumes. ',
                'On Mars, manufacturing costs will be higher and consumption '
                'patterns quite different. In particular, Mars production '
                'requires enormous quantities of methane and oxygen to refuel '
                'Starships flying back to Earth, as well as the local '
                'production of materials which are scarce on Mars but common '
                'on Earth, such as nitrogen. These are shown in the modified '
                'graph below.',
                'This graph shows all the same commodities with Mars '
                'consumption and production cost modified by several educated '
                'guesses. A city attempting industrial closure with a small '
                'number of people must have extremely high ',
                ' productivity, at least by Earth standards. This implies a '
                'higher ',
                'production cost and consumption. In addition, basic raw '
                'materials are also consumed at much higher rates and costs in '
                'order to fuel both industry and Starships.',
                'Despite these larger numbers, local production of raw '
                'materials still costs less than $100/kg, which is less than '
                'they could ever cost to import even if Starships were free. '
                'This suggests that even in a future where Starship is able to '
                'deliver cargo to the surface of Mars for 20x less than Falcon '
                'can deliver to LEO today, local production is still favored.',
                'Finally, let’s take a look at the same graph, but with costs '
                'determined by import, at a base rate of $200/kg. $200/kg is '
                'extremely ambitious but not physically impossible. ',

                'methane, and water, are beyond ridiculous in an import '

                'an ore body as the whole planet is made of rocks. '
                'Importantly, none of these materials will require incredibly '

                'equipment with science fiction capabilities.',
                'Mars’ atmosphere provides limitless quantities of nitrogen '

                'turn all the hydrogen needed to synthesize methane (',
                '). Rubble can be processed from generic local regolith, and '
                'will be used in large volumes for thermal and radiation '
                'shielding, road building, cement, and masonry. This is '
                'notable distinct from, eg, titanium, which will require the '
                'discovery of concentrated ore somewhere, plus the creation of '
                'a local mining town to extract and refine the product before '
                'trucking it back to the city. ',
                'Finally, processing all these materials requires the local '
                'generation of electricity, either with large photovoltaic '
                'solar farms, or nuclear power plants. The power requirement '
                'will be around 10 kW/',
                'Because solar farms are essentially two dimensional, panels '

                '. Without further local production, annual ',
                'material imports would be around 10 T at a cost of $2m. ',
                'Cutting this mass requirement back by a few orders of '
                'magnitude would enable human immigrants to Mars to rise, as a '
                'fraction of the total mass flux, from about 0.1% to 20% or '
                'more, an increase of a factor of 200. If the McMurdo analog '
                'city housed 1200 people with ',
                ' turnover of 400 every 26 months, roughly 180 Starships would '
                'be needed for resupply and perhaps just two or three for '
                'passenger transport. With the same 7 year tours of duty, the '
                'same sized Starship fleet could support a base with a '
                'population of over 100,000, if Mars-manufacture of basic '
                'commodities permitted the fleet to mostly carry people and '
                'their personal supplies. For reference, a fleet of 185 '
                'Starships would require roughly 500 launches per year for LEO '
                'refilling, and would cost about $7b/year to operate given '
                'launch costs of $10m and single trip cargo Starships costing '
                '$10m to produce. Under this paradigm, growing Starship '
                'production capacity could support a city of a million people '
                'for less than $70b/year, and that’s assuming everyone still '
                'comes home after a 7 year term of duty. If most migrants are '
                'traveling one way, net transport of 150,000 people to Mars '
                'every 26 months would require the production and launch of '
                '400 Starships every launch window, at a total program cost of '
                'just $28b.',
                'Even better, for commodities whose annual ',
                'consumption falls between roughly 10 kg and 10 T, moving '
                'production to Mars is enormously competitive and thus '
                'enormously profitable. While local production of eye-watering '
                'quantities of water, oxygen, methane, aggregate, and nitrogen '
                'is a basic necessity for any kind of viable Mars base, '

                'fasteners, chemicals, glass, copper, and some textiles would '

                'this transition would lower ',
                'material imports from 10 T to perhaps 20 kg, reducing the '
                'cost of these commodities from $2m to around $100,000. The '
                'Mars city’s average GDP ',
                ' will be at least 10x the US average today, meaning around '
                '$650,000. Import costs, while still substantial and '
                'unbalanced, will be less than 15% of total economic activity.',
                'What about commodities with consumption below 10 kg/',

                'importation cost penalty is roughly the same as the Mars '
                'manufacturing difficulty penalty. That is, there is no strong '
                'economic reason to onshore production. There are '
                'non-economic, strategic reasons to onshore at least partial '
                'local production of 6502 processors or electric motors, but '
                'it’s unlikely to be wildly profitable without some kind of '
                'import tariff. ',
                'Indeed, a 4-9 month interplanetary voyage on Starship would '
                'require a few hundred kilograms of consumables per passenger, '
                'plus a personal luggage allocation of a similar size. So it '

                ' of underwear, flash memory, and pharmaceuticals, without '
                'significantly affecting the per-passenger mass overhead. In '

                'extremely high value and low mass high tech and luxury items '

                'While this analysis has been prepared using a Mars cargo '

                'paintings on the tombs" where the figures they depict are '
                '"walking like an Egyptian." Though he was neither an art '
                'historian nor an Egyptologist, songwriter Liam Sternberg was '
                'referring to one of the most striking features of ',
                ' visual art — the depiction of people, animals and objects on '
                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '
                'below.',

                'approaches to representation on a flat surface," Baines '
                'said.\xa0',
                '"It [Egyptian art] influenced art in the ancient Near East," '
                'such as ancient Syrian (or Levantine) and ',

                '“It is a sign of the speed at which events are moving that '
                'Hurst and Blackett’s unexpurgated edition of\xa0',
                ', published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler '
                'angle. The obvious intention of the translator’s preface and '
                'notes is to tone down the book’s ferocity and present Hitler '
                'in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was '
                'still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, '
                'and for that the property-owning classes were willing to '
                'forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in '
                'the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a '
                'version of Conservatism.',
                'Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable '
                'after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett’s '
                'edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all '
                'profits would be devoted to the Red Cross. Nevertheless, '
                'simply on the internal evidence of\xa0',
                ', it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken '
                'place in Hitler’s aims and opinions. When one compares his '
                'utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years '
                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '
                'version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have '
                'enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their '
                'peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more '
                'grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ '
                'Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and '
                'death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his '
                'feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change '
                'their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years '
                'of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the '
                'greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better '
                'an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner. '
                'Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we '
                'ought not to underrate its emotional appeal.”',

                'meals; it came to over $2,500. Both were very conservative '
                'estimates, but they changed my habits dramatically when I saw '

                'coffees and meals significantly adds up across days, weeks, '
                'and months.',
                'I recently applied the same principle to my subscriptions. '
                'Over the past several years, as more and more apps have moved '
                'from standalone releases to yearly subscription pricing, the '
                'drip of yearly costs continues to accrue. What I find '
                'difficult about subscription pricing is that I very quickly '
                'habituate to it, the monthly fees becoming just another '
                'expense in the litany of other costs that are part of '
                'adulting. They become invisible.',
                "So this isn't a repudiation of subscription models; more an "
                'experiment to 1) become more aware of what I was spending and '
                '2) assess whether I was happy with the value I was getting '
                'from these apps. Do you know how much you spend across all '
                'your monthly subscriptions?',
                'The first step was to go into Settings and calculate the '
                'subscriptions listed there, including many of my streaming, '
                'note-taking, and productivity apps. Then I tracked down '
                'subscriptions I bought outside the App Store, including for '
                'apps like Sketch, MLB, and NordVPN.\xa0',
                'I currently divide my subscriptions into three categories. '
                'The first are apps that, if I stopped paying for them, I '
                'would 1) lose access to (e.g. Disney+, Audm, etc.), or 2) '
                'would severely curtail their functionality (e.g. Day One, '
                'Grammarly). The second category is apps that I purchased '
                'outright and have a hybrid approach where they receive '
                'updates for a while (e.g. one year) after purchase. For these '
                'apps, receiving new updates and features requires purchasing '
                'another year of updates, but most existing features prior to '
                'that date remain fully functional. Apps like Agenda, Nova, & '
                'CleanShot X follow this model. And finally, the third '
                'category is subscription applications I purchased a lifetime '
                'license for. This tier is often 2-5x the cost of an annual '
                'subscription, but it gives me access to the app and all its '
                'features for as long as it is supported. Apps like Calm, '

                'Most modern languages (that aren’t JavaScript) now ship with '

                'created after 2003 that didn’t come with a third-party '
                'package repository of some sort. CPAN moved the line so that '
                'from then forward, a “real” programming language needed to '
                'have a strategy for third-party package management.',
                'Ok, so you might wonder, if CPAN made Perl better and every '
                'language moving forward embraced package managers for '
                'third-party code, why didn’t languages predating this add on '
                'package managers after the fact?',
                'Well, they did, but it doesn’t seem obvious how to get '
                'agreement in a language community after a certain point. I’m '
                'not sure why this is, but maybe people don’t like change?',
                'This is going to be a running theme. Once the idioms and '
                'patterns of a programming language, and a language community, '
                'have been established its hard to go back and add things on. '

                'One counter point on backporting here though is standard '
                'libraries. C++ added its standard library rather late in the '
                'game, by successfully bringing parts of STL under its roof. '

                'Explorer. But, out of school and professional necessity, I '
                'had to make the switch to Google Chrome.',
                'For the most part, it worked out for me. It had features that '
                'Firefox at the time didn’t, like being able to sync and '
                'access tabs from other devices or saving all my bookmarks '
                'under a single profile that I could transfer to other '
                'PCs.\xa0',
                'Then over the years, Google became more invasive. It, like '
                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '
                'processing power is especially a problem for laptops or other '
                'devices with very little RAM.',
                'Which is why Mozilla Firefox is such a breath of fresh air, '
                'as it uses much less of your CPU while still delivering a '
                'fast browsing experience. So feel free to have as many tabs '
                'open as you want in Firefox, your device will barely feel the '

                'patches, but present a host of challenges. If the device '
                'performs safety-critical functions, like actuating power, '
                'medical equipment, or a connected car, the firmware and '
                'software cannot be updated without rigorous testing. If the '
                'device requires certification, updating it may require '
                'recertification. Updates are disruptive and need to be '
                'scheduled when the device is not performing its critical '
                'functions. Even just performing the update presents risks: if '
                'the update ends up bricking millions of devices and requires '
                'manual intervention, it could prove an existential risk to '
                'the business or the safety of individuals.',
                'As a result, edge firmware and software typically have long '
                'release cycles with significant hardware-in-the-loop testing. '
                'Firmware and software are usually bundled together and are '
                'only updated on the order of weeks or months. There is a '
                'natural reluctance to update any code at run-time given the '
                'potential for bugs and remote code execution (RCE) '
                'vulnerabilities. This makes iterating on product '
                'improvements, or quickly providing security patches, '
                'difficult.',
                'A firmware component that provides critical functions must '
                'always have a rigorous testing and release process. However, '
                'for a software component, it would provide a huge competitive '
                'advantage if it could be updated flexibly, even on-demand. '
                'Imagine the potential to iterate on a machine learning model '
                'daily, rather than every few months.',
                'This is why I find both the execution model and the security '
                'model of WebAssembly exciting. WebAssembly binaries can be '
                'very small, sometimes on the order of bytes, and they are '
                'portable across platforms. In terms of security, WebAssembly '
                'executes in a sandbox and the basic instruction set provides '
                'for nothing more than pure functions—numerical operations on '
                'its own memory. The WebAssembly code cannot read from, or '
                'write to, the file system, open ports, or access shared '
                'memory. The WebAssembly code can take advantage of functions '
                'or variables provided by the host, but only if the host '
                'provides these explicitly through imports. In other words, '
                'the host is in full control of what the WebAssembly code can '
                'do. The host can even limit the memory used or meter the '
                'number of instructions executed by the WebAssembly code. For '
                'building more complex applications that need to open ports or '
                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',
                'The adoption of WebAssembly in the cloud is limited, but it '

                'the vendor is running untrusted code, often in a multi-tenant '
                'environment, the strict sandboxing protects the vendor '
                'against malicious or buggy code, and helps provide tenant '

                'all the way to cloud services. I am excited about WebAssembly '
                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '
                'developer for productivity, portability, and security.',
                'The ability to move computation from the cloud to the edge is '
                'revolutionary. Computation can be developed, tested, and '
                'benchmarked in the cloud using historical data stored in the '
                'cloud, simulated data, or live data streamed or queried from '
                'the IoT device. When you are satisfied with the results, the '
                'code can be moved from the cloud to the edge.',
                ' WebAssembly binaries are small, so they can be stored as '
                'configuration and synchronized to the IoT devices using '
                'existing mechanisms for desired-state configuration '
                'management. This makes it possible  to iterate on edge '
                'computation, reliably and securely, in hours or days, rather '
                'than weeks or months. Even experimental computation, for '
                'example, a new machine learning model, can run at the edge in '
                'shadow mode and report results back to the cloud for '
                'evaluation. In addition to this flexibility, moving '
                'computation to the edge can provide significant costs savings '
                'by taking advantage of existing edge computation, rather than '
                'consuming additional cloud resources.',
                'I have extensive experience with ',
                ', a toolkit for actor-model programming, distributed '
                'computing, and streaming data. Akka has been a wonderful '
                'platform for building reliable and scalable services for IoT. '
                'With Akka, the run-time is abstracted from the developer. The '
                'developer writes pure functions that are then composed into '
                'actors or streams. For actors, the run-time handles '
                'concurrency, distribution, location transparency, and '
                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '
                'binary, when all the developer is really concerned about is '
                'writing the business logic associated with each route. As a '
                'result, developers end up maintaining a lot of boilerplate '
                'and framework code.',
                'To demonstrate the challenge, consider hundreds of services '
                'using an HTTP server compiled into the application binary. '
                'There are likely many different versions depending on when '
                'the application was last compiled and deployed. If there is a '
                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '
                'logic? This would be similar to how host operating systems '
                'can be patched underneath Kubernetes and no one needs to '
                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '
                'model, but with even less boilerplate and richer primitives '

                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '

                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '

                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '

                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '

                'controlled individually, which makes them really versatile '
                'for use in e.g. home automation. Throughout my home there are '
                'several strips, each adapting their hue to the current time '
                'of day and showing all sorts of information, such as the '
                'current time and rain forecasts using radar data fetched '
                'online. Pretty neat! But how do you get these strips to show '
                'more than just a solid color (i.e. visual effects or '
                'animations), and actually use them as ‘dashboards’ in a '
                'scalable and maintainable way? In this project, I start out '
                'with a simple and robust (but not very powerful) solution, '
                'and end up with a ',
                ' over-engineered, but very flexible solution to this problem '
                'involving a custom programming language and bytecode '
                'instruction set.',
                'The recommended approach for controlling LED strips like this '
                'is by using ',
                '. ESPHome is a service that allows you to compile custom '
                'firmware for ESP8266, which can control LED strips (among '
                'many other things!) and allows for easy integration with ',
                '. The main benefit of ESPHome is easy device management: '
                'remote updating and reconfiguration is fully automated. '
                'Swapping out a broken ESP8266 or board is as easy as '
                'downloading the right firmware image from ESPHome, flashing '
                'it over USB, and swapping the hardware. The ESPHome firmware '
                'allows color and brightness to be set (from e.g. Home '
                'Assistant) for all LEDs at the same time. One way to make an '
                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',
                'Ideally, we would like to send short ‘animations’ or videos '
                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '
                'where the last nibble determines the number of bytes to pop '
                '(conveniently making ‘0x00’ a no-operation). Similary, ‘0x11’ '
                'means ‘push a single byte’ (the byte to be pushed is the next '
                'byte in the code stream), 0x32 means ‘push the next 8 bytes '
                'as two integers’, et cetera. There are also operators (0x8• '
                'are binary operators, e.g. 0x80 is ‘add’ and 0x81 is '
                '‘subtract’) and jump instructions. Finally there are special '
                'instructions that push the length of the LED strip to the '
                'stack (0xe0 = get_length) and to set a pixel (0xe3 = '
                'set_pixel). ',
                'As an example, consider a simple program that loops from '
                '(get_length) down to zero:',
                'Next, I wrote a simple parser in Rust that could read a '
                'simple ‘programming language’ and compile it to the byte code '
                'just defined. For example, the program above can be written '
                'as:',
                'The equivalent of the example script above in this language '
                'would be the following:',
                'In the above, the ‘blit’ keyword tells the controller to send '
                'the LED strip ‘image’ created by the program (by calls to '
                'set_pixel) to the LED strip. The above program would '
                'effectively set all LEDs to yellow (RGB 255, 255, 0). The '
                'byte code for this program is as follows:',
                '17 bytes! (note that this works for strips of any length too. '
                'Nice.).',
                'Executing this code on an ESP8266 is very simply done using a '
                'for loop that iterates over the instructions, a giant switch '
                'statement that determines which instruction it is (based on '
                'the first nibble). The stack is simply an array of 32-bit '
                'integers with a separate value pointing at the last inserted '
                'item. Finally, there is a buffer for the LED data to be '
                'written to (by set_pixel). Even with this naive approach it '

                'neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from '
                'the UK Biobank which contains information on nearly 500,000 '

                'matter in several areas of the brain.',
                'These regions included the hippocampus, which is a crucial '

                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '
                'exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few '
                'examples of factors that keep people from socializing and '
                'connecting with others.',
                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '
                'loneliness and health comes from studies examining mortality '

                'poverty also leads to more piracy. This flywheel effect may '

                'strong in developing countries.',

                'topic here to have another go and to help future readers, '
                'including me, get quantitative on this subject.',
                'There are three intuitions which underlie this discussion. ',
                'A less terrible version of the diagram is given below.',
                'The diagram shows a mix of industrial sectors (eg all steel) '
                'and also particular products as representatives of entire '
                'sectors (beyond burger for highly processed food). These '
                'products are graphed according to their annual ',
                ' consumption (horizontal axis) and annual ',
                ' cost (vertical axis). On the far right we have water, which '
                'is incredibly cheap despite us using far more of it than '
                'anything else. As we trend to the left, we traverse steadily '
                'more sophisticated products with higher unit costs and lower '
                'production volumes. ',
                'On Mars, manufacturing costs will be higher and consumption '
                'patterns quite different. In particular, Mars production '
                'requires enormous quantities of methane and oxygen to refuel '
                'Starships flying back to Earth, as well as the local '
                'production of materials which are scarce on Mars but common '
                'on Earth, such as nitrogen. These are shown in the modified '
                'graph below.',
                'This graph shows all the same commodities with Mars '
                'consumption and production cost modified by several educated '
                'guesses. A city attempting industrial closure with a small '
                'number of people must have extremely high ',
                ' productivity, at least by Earth standards. This implies a '
                'higher ',
                'production cost and consumption. In addition, basic raw '
                'materials are also consumed at much higher rates and costs in '
                'order to fuel both industry and Starships.',
                'Despite these larger numbers, local production of raw '
                'materials still costs less than $100/kg, which is less than '
                'they could ever cost to import even if Starships were free. '
                'This suggests that even in a future where Starship is able to '
                'deliver cargo to the surface of Mars for 20x less than Falcon '
                'can deliver to LEO today, local production is still favored.',
                'Finally, let’s take a look at the same graph, but with costs '
                'determined by import, at a base rate of $200/kg. $200/kg is '
                'extremely ambitious but not physically impossible. ',
                'At $200/kg, the cost of nearly every import falls on the '
                'green diagonal, indicating that importation is the major cost '
                'driver. Indeed, very few commodities have higher unit prices '
                'than this. This is the main reason that ',

                'methane, and water, are beyond ridiculous in an import '
                'scenario. For industrial scale water consumption without '

                'In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) is absolutely mandatory '

                'section of the graph, including nitrogen, concrete, oxygen, '
                'rubble, methane, and water. Fortunately, all of these '

                'solid-phase. For crushed rocks, it is not necessary to find '
                'an ore body as the whole planet is made of rocks. '
                'Importantly, none of these materials will require incredibly '
                'sophisticated remotely operated robotic mining and refining '
                'equipment with science fiction capabilities.',
                'Mars’ atmosphere provides limitless quantities of nitrogen '
                'and CO2, requiring only an intake, compressor, dust filter, '
                'and cryogenic distillation for separation. A subsurface water '
                'well (either into ice or an aquifer) provides water and, in '
                'turn all the hydrogen needed to synthesize methane (',
                '). Rubble can be processed from generic local regolith, and '
                'will be used in large volumes for thermal and radiation '
                'shielding, road building, cement, and masonry. This is '
                'notable distinct from, eg, titanium, which will require the '
                'discovery of concentrated ore somewhere, plus the creation of '
                'a local mining town to extract and refine the product before '
                'trucking it back to the city. ',
                'Finally, processing all these materials requires the local '
                'generation of electricity, either with large photovoltaic '
                'solar farms, or nuclear power plants. The power requirement '
                'will be around 10 kW/',
                'Because solar farms are essentially two dimensional, panels '
                'can be made extremely thin and light, with a ',
                'panel mass allocation of less than 100 kg. ',
                'Establishing a local supply chain for these generically '
                'available raw materials lowers the cost of marginal '
                'immigration to the point where it’s conceivably possible to '
                'operate a large outpost, similar in scope to ',
                '. Without further local production, annual ',
                'material imports would be around 10 T at a cost of $2m. ',
                'Cutting this mass requirement back by a few orders of '
                'magnitude would enable human immigrants to Mars to rise, as a '
                'fraction of the total mass flux, from about 0.1% to 20% or '
                'more, an increase of a factor of 200. If the McMurdo analog '
                'city housed 1200 people with ',
                ' turnover of 400 every 26 months, roughly 180 Starships would '
                'be needed for resupply and perhaps just two or three for '
                'passenger transport. With the same 7 year tours of duty, the '
                'same sized Starship fleet could support a base with a '
                'population of over 100,000, if Mars-manufacture of basic '
                'commodities permitted the fleet to mostly carry people and '
                'their personal supplies. For reference, a fleet of 185 '
                'Starships would require roughly 500 launches per year for LEO '
                'refilling, and would cost about $7b/year to operate given '
                'launch costs of $10m and single trip cargo Starships costing '
                '$10m to produce. Under this paradigm, growing Starship '
                'production capacity could support a city of a million people '
                'for less than $70b/year, and that’s assuming everyone still '
                'comes home after a 7 year term of duty. If most migrants are '
                'traveling one way, net transport of 150,000 people to Mars '
                'every 26 months would require the production and launch of '
                '400 Starships every launch window, at a total program cost of '
                'just $28b.',
                'Even better, for commodities whose annual ',
                'consumption falls between roughly 10 kg and 10 T, moving '
                'production to Mars is enormously competitive and thus '
                'enormously profitable. While local production of eye-watering '
                'quantities of water, oxygen, methane, aggregate, and nitrogen '
                'is a basic necessity for any kind of viable Mars base, '
                'onshoring production of steel, food staples, plastics, '
                'fasteners, chemicals, glass, copper, and some textiles would '
                'drive the city’s economic engine of expansion. Completing '
                'this transition would lower ',
                'material imports from 10 T to perhaps 20 kg, reducing the '
                'cost of these commodities from $2m to around $100,000. The '
                'Mars city’s average GDP ',
                ' will be at least 10x the US average today, meaning around '
                '$650,000. Import costs, while still substantial and '
                'unbalanced, will be less than 15% of total economic activity.',
                'What about commodities with consumption below 10 kg/',

                'importation cost penalty is roughly the same as the Mars '
                'manufacturing difficulty penalty. That is, there is no strong '
                'economic reason to onshore production. There are '
                'non-economic, strategic reasons to onshore at least partial '
                'local production of 6502 processors or electric motors, but '

                'In 1986, the band "The Bangles" sang about "all the old '
                'paintings on the tombs" where the figures they depict are '
                '"walking like an Egyptian." Though he was neither an art '
                'historian nor an Egyptologist, songwriter Liam Sternberg was '
                'referring to one of the most striking features of ',
                ' visual art — the depiction of people, animals and objects on '
                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '
                'below.',

                '—',
                '—',
                'Egyptian visual art used "more or less universal human '
                'approaches to representation on a flat surface," Baines '
                'said.\xa0',
                '"It [Egyptian art] influenced art in the ancient Near East," '
                'such as ancient Syrian (or Levantine) and ',
                ' art, Baines said. The same conventions can be seen in many '
                'other ancient traditions of art. ',
                ' art also uses pictorial scenes and hieroglyphic script. '
                'Although classical Greek and ',
                ' art is an exception, there are even examples of similar '
                'artistic conventions for two-dimensional drawing and painting '
                'from medieval Europe. As Baines explained, "It\'s a system '

                ' and ',
                ' are integers then ',
                ' will do integer division, rounding the result down. In '
                'JavaScript ',
                ' will always be a floating point division with a floating '

                "more work. Of course you don't want your bitwise operator to "

                'such as ',
                ' or ',

                ' instruction since it does nothing. But the real work is in '
                'all that slow conversion to and from floating point. It turns '
                'out that if you add a ',
                ' after every operation, your JavaScript JIT compiler can skip '
                'the redundant conversions too, and just keep your numbers as '
                'integers the whole time. When the inputs to a division are '
                'known to be integers, and ',
                ' converts it to integer again afterward, then instead of '
                'emitting two conversions to floating point, a floating point '
                'division instruction, and then a conversion to integer, the '
                'JIT can emit a single integer division instruction, just like '
                'a C compiler would. This is pretty miraculous!',
                "All of JavaScript's bitwise operators inherited from C "
                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',
                ' after your arithmetic operations, and for unsigned you use ',
                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '
                'floating-point division of two integers less than 2',
                ' and then converting the result to an integer gives the exact '
                'same result as an integer division instruction in every case. '
                "But the full range of 64 bit integers isn't representable in "
                'double precision floating point, and JavaScript numbers '
                'always have to behave as if they are represented by double '
                "precision floating point values even when that isn't true. "
                "The JIT compiler can't just do 64-bit integer math under the "
                "covers and pretend that it's floating point, because it would "
                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',
                "OK, 64-bit doesn't work, how about 16-bit and 8-bit? Well, on "
                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "
                'so bad, because CPUs add 32-bit numbers just as fast as 8-bit '
                'numbers. Where smaller types ',
                ' matter is in memory usage. If you want an array of bytes, '
                'but you use a JavaScript array to store JavaScript numbers '
                'instead, it will use 8 times the memory (and 8 times the '
                'memory bandwidth, and 8 times the cache space) because every '
                'JavaScript number is 8 bytes. Thankfully JavaScript has a '
                'solution for this too: typed arrays. Typed arrays can hold '
                '8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values in both signed and unsigned '
                "varieties. As an added benefit, since typed arrays can't hold "
                "object references, the garbage collector doesn't need to scan "
                'their contents, which also helps performance.',
                "Bonus question: what about 32-bit floating point? It's faster "
                'than 64-bit floating point, and used a lot in 3D graphics. '
                'Can we use a similar trick to make the JavaScript JIT emit '
                "32-bit float math instructions? The answer is yes, there's a "
                'function ',
                " used for this purpose by asm.js. I've never tried using it "

                'Asm.js uses these techniques to translate C code to '

                'benefit. Anytime you want good performance in JavaScript, you '

                ', published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler '
                'angle. The obvious intention of the translator’s preface and '
                'notes is to tone down the book’s ferocity and present Hitler '
                'in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was '
                'still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, '
                'and for that the property-owning classes were willing to '
                'forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in '
                'the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a '
                'version of Conservatism.',
                'Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable '
                'after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett’s '
                'edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all '

                ', it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken '
                'place in Hitler’s aims and opinions. When one compares his '
                'utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years '
                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '
                'version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have '
                'enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their '
                'peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more '
                'grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ '
                'Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and '
                'death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his '
                'feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change '
                'their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years '
                'of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the '
                'greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better '
                'an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner. '
                'Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we '

                'its own memory. The WebAssembly code cannot read from, or '
                'write to, the file system, open ports, or access shared '
                'memory. The WebAssembly code can take advantage of functions '
                'or variables provided by the host, but only if the host '
                'provides these explicitly through imports. In other words, '
                'the host is in full control of what the WebAssembly code can '
                'do. The host can even limit the memory used or meter the '
                'number of instructions executed by the WebAssembly code. For '
                'building more complex applications that need to open ports or '
                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',
                'The adoption of WebAssembly in the cloud is limited, but it '

                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '
                'developer for productivity, portability, and security.',
                'The ability to move computation from the cloud to the edge is '
                'revolutionary. Computation can be developed, tested, and '
                'benchmarked in the cloud using historical data stored in the '
                'cloud, simulated data, or live data streamed or queried from '
                'the IoT device. When you are satisfied with the results, the '
                'code can be moved from the cloud to the edge.',
                ' WebAssembly binaries are small, so they can be stored as '
                'configuration and synchronized to the IoT devices using '
                'existing mechanisms for desired-state configuration '
                'management. This makes it possible  to iterate on edge '
                'computation, reliably and securely, in hours or days, rather '
                'than weeks or months. Even experimental computation, for '
                'example, a new machine learning model, can run at the edge in '
                'shadow mode and report results back to the cloud for '
                'evaluation. In addition to this flexibility, moving '
                'computation to the edge can provide significant costs savings '
                'by taking advantage of existing edge computation, rather than '
                'consuming additional cloud resources.',
                'I have extensive experience with ',
                ', a toolkit for actor-model programming, distributed '
                'computing, and streaming data. Akka has been a wonderful '
                'platform for building reliable and scalable services for IoT. '
                'With Akka, the run-time is abstracted from the developer. The '
                'developer writes pure functions that are then composed into '
                'actors or streams. For actors, the run-time handles '
                'concurrency, distribution, location transparency, and '
                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '
                'binary, when all the developer is really concerned about is '
                'writing the business logic associated with each route. As a '
                'result, developers end up maintaining a lot of boilerplate '
                'and framework code.',
                'To demonstrate the challenge, consider hundreds of services '
                'using an HTTP server compiled into the application binary. '
                'There are likely many different versions depending on when '
                'the application was last compiled and deployed. If there is a '
                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '
                'logic? This would be similar to how host operating systems '
                'can be patched underneath Kubernetes and no one needs to '
                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '

                'is portable across run-times, but changing from one host '
                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '
                'portable way, WASI, or another standard built on top of WASI, '
                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '
                'machine. Python, however, feels awkward. If my understanding '
                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '
                'from a language that is strongly typed, supports functional '
                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '
                'language for any new development.',

                'The year is 2008 and I had been using Mozilla Firefox for two '
                'years after my painful but inevitable breakup with Internet '
                'Explorer. But, out of school and professional necessity, I '
                'had to make the switch to Google Chrome.',
                'For the most part, it worked out for me. It had features that '
                'Firefox at the time didn’t, like being able to sync and '
                'access tabs from other devices or saving all my bookmarks '
                'under a single profile that I could transfer to other '
                'PCs.\xa0',
                'Then over the years, Google became more invasive. It, like '
                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '
                'processing power is especially a problem for laptops or other '
                'devices with very little RAM.',
                'Which is why Mozilla Firefox is such a breath of fresh air, '
                'as it uses much less of your CPU while still delivering a '
                'fast browsing experience. So feel free to have as many tabs '
                'open as you want in Firefox, your device will barely feel the '
                'effects.',

                'meals; it came to over $2,500. Both were very conservative '
                'estimates, but they changed my habits dramatically when I saw '
                'the potential of saving a sizable portion of the 4-grand if I '
                'chose to eat out less on campus. That slow drip spent on '
                'coffees and meals significantly adds up across days, weeks, '
                'and months.',
                'I recently applied the same principle to my subscriptions. '
                'Over the past several years, as more and more apps have moved '
                'from standalone releases to yearly subscription pricing, the '
                'drip of yearly costs continues to accrue. What I find '
                'difficult about subscription pricing is that I very quickly '
                'habituate to it, the monthly fees becoming just another '
                'expense in the litany of other costs that are part of '
                'adulting. They become invisible.',
                "So this isn't a repudiation of subscription models; more an "
                'experiment to 1) become more aware of what I was spending and '
                '2) assess whether I was happy with the value I was getting '
                'from these apps. Do you know how much you spend across all '
                'your monthly subscriptions?',

                'apps like Sketch, MLB, and NordVPN.\xa0',
                'I currently divide my subscriptions into three categories. '
                'The first are apps that, if I stopped paying for them, I '
                'would 1) lose access to (e.g. Disney+, Audm, etc.), or 2) '
                'would severely curtail their functionality (e.g. Day One, '
                'Grammarly). The second category is apps that I purchased '
                'outright and have a hybrid approach where they receive '
                'updates for a while (e.g. one year) after purchase. For these '

                'another year of updates, but most existing features prior to '
                'that date remain fully functional. Apps like Agenda, Nova, & '
                'CleanShot X follow this model. And finally, the third '
                'category is subscription applications I purchased a lifetime '
                'license for. This tier is often 2-5x the cost of an annual '
                'subscription, but it gives me access to the app and all its '

                'I’ve sketched out this very simple circuit - the ESP32 only '

                'two 10K resistors halve the maximum 4.2V that the battery '
                'will output down to 2.1V.',
                'To discharge the battery I’ve got a 5W 7.5 ohm resistor and '
                'I’m switching this into the circuit using a power MOSFET. '

                'When the MOSFET is turned on, the total resistance that the '
                'battery will be connected to is 8.6ohms - so we’ll use that '
                'to calculate the current flowing.',
                'I’ve also measured the two potential divider resistors to '
                'make sure my voltage calculations are correct.',
                'Having said that, the ADC on the ESP32 is notoriously '
                'inaccurate, so we’ll only really be able to get approximate '

                'so I’m taking multiple measurements and then averaging the '
                'result.',
                'The software is very simple. We start off in an idle state '
                'with the MOSFET switched off.',
                'When we connect the battery we see the voltage go above 4v '
                'and switch into the measuring state. We turn on the MOSFET, '

                'It works pretty well - we’re in the same ballpark as the '

                'are going to be pretty inaccurate.',
                'My measurement of the total resistance when the MOSFET is '
                'turned on is probably not very accurate, my multimeter is a '
                'pretty cheap one. And we are dealing with the ESP32’s very '
                'inaccurate ADC.',
                'I’ve also recorded the battery voltage on the serial monitor '

                'These seem to match the curves that I see online for '
                'batteries so that’s a pretty good result!',
                'We can also get an estimate for the internal DC resistance of '
                'the batteries. We can see that the battery voltage under load '
                'was 4.078V, assuming the battery was fuly charged to 4.2V '
                'we’re dropping 0.122V in the battery.',
                'Given the current of 0.474A we can calculate the internal '
                'resistance to be approximately 0.26ohms.',
                'This is obviously a very approximate calculation given all '
                'the errors in the our system.',
                'So we’ve got a couple of healthy batteries, you would think '
                'we can go ahead and use them in our projects - well, not so '
                'fast batman.',
                'But there’s one issue - there is no battery protection board.',
                'That’s fine if we always use our charging board with the '
                'built in battery protection, but we really should not use '
                'these bare batteries anywhere else. We need to make them '
                'safe.',

                'Everything is now wrapped up in Kapton tape and we’ve got a '

                'We can see this in the discharge graph - I’ve changed the '
                'code so that it does turn off the MOSFET unless the voltage '
                'drops below 2.5V. But as you can see when we drop to 3V the '

                'interaction, then we should anticipate this to have a '
                'substantial impact.',
                'A recent study published in Neurology indicates that social '
                'isolation increases the risk of dementia in older people and '
                'is as well associated with changes in brain structure and '
                'cognition, which is the mental process of learning.',
                'The social brain hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the '
                'human brain specifically evolved to support social '
                'interactions, is already well supported by a large body of '
                'research.',
                'In one investigation, the social interaction-related brain '
                'areas of almost 7,000 individuals were mapped. It '
                'demonstrated a strong relationship between brain regions '
                'consistently involved in various social interactions and '
                'networks that underpin cognition.',
                'This also includes the default mode network – active when we '
                'are not paying attention to the outside world, the salience '
                'network, the subcortical network, which is involved in '
                'memory, emotion and motivation as well as the central '
                'executive network, which enables us to regulate our emotions.',
                'The goal of this research is to learn more about the impact '
                'of social isolation on grey matter, which is made up of '
                'neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from '
                'the UK Biobank which contains information on nearly 500,000 '
                'individuals with an average age of 57 was used.',

                'lived alone, interacted with other people less frequently '
                'than once a month and engaged in social activities less '
                'frequently than once a week.',
                'Approximately 32,000 individuals’ neuroimaging (MRI) results '
                'were also included in the study. This demonstrated that those '
                'who are socially isolated have lower levels of cognition, '
                'including memory and reaction time as well as less grey '
                'matter in several areas of the brain.',
                'These regions included the hippocampus, which is a crucial '
                'area involved in learning and memory that is typically '
                'disrupted early in Alzheimer’s illness, the temporal region, '

                'Another aspect might be that an individual\xa0loses some of '

                'ability to use language and other cognitive functions like '
                'attention and memory will decline.',
                'Also, due to the fact that memory and attention are essential '
                'for complex cognitive thinking generally, this may impair '

                'A national poll on loneliness conducted in 2019 found that '
                'living alone or far from family members increased the chance '
                'of loneliness. People who are unsatisfied with their social '
                'and family\xa0lives are also more likely to say they are '
                'lonely than people who are not.',
                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '
                'exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few '
                'examples of factors that keep people from socializing and '
                'connecting with others.',
                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '
                'loneliness and health comes from studies examining mortality '
                'as an outcome. A considerable body of evidence has '
                'accumulated over the last four decades, consisting of ',
                ' and hundreds of large-scale prospective epidemiological '
                'investigations.',
                'According to this data, having a strong social network '
                'greatly lowers the probability of dying young from any cause. '
                'By way of illustration, a meta-analysis of 148 prospective '
                'studies discovered that social connection (averaged across a '
                'range of criteria) enhances survival probabilities by 50%.',

                'for use in e.g. home automation. Throughout my home there are '
                'several strips, each adapting their hue to the current time '
                'of day and showing all sorts of information, such as the '
                'current time and rain forecasts using radar data fetched '
                'online. Pretty neat! But how do you get these strips to show '
                'more than just a solid color (i.e. visual effects or '
                'animations), and actually use them as ‘dashboards’ in a '
                'scalable and maintainable way? In this project, I start out '
                'with a simple and robust (but not very powerful) solution, '
                'and end up with a ',
                ' over-engineered, but very flexible solution to this problem '
                'involving a custom programming language and bytecode '
                'instruction set.',
                'The recommended approach for controlling LED strips like this '
                'is by using ',
                '. ESPHome is a service that allows you to compile custom '
                'firmware for ESP8266, which can control LED strips (among '
                'many other things!) and allows for easy integration with ',
                '. The main benefit of ESPHome is easy device management: '
                'remote updating and reconfiguration is fully automated. '
                'Swapping out a broken ESP8266 or board is as easy as '
                'downloading the right firmware image from ESPHome, flashing '
                'it over USB, and swapping the hardware. The ESPHome firmware '
                'allows color and brightness to be set (from e.g. Home '
                'Assistant) for all LEDs at the same time. One way to make an '
                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',
                'Ideally, we would like to send short ‘animations’ or videos '
                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '
                'where the last nibble determines the number of bytes to pop '
                '(conveniently making ‘0x00’ a no-operation). Similary, ‘0x11’ '
                'means ‘push a single byte’ (the byte to be pushed is the next '
                'byte in the code stream), 0x32 means ‘push the next 8 bytes '
                'as two integers’, et cetera. There are also operators (0x8• '
                'are binary operators, e.g. 0x80 is ‘add’ and 0x81 is '
                '‘subtract’) and jump instructions. Finally there are special '
                'instructions that push the length of the LED strip to the '
                'stack (0xe0 = get_length) and to set a pixel (0xe3 = '
                'set_pixel). ',
                'As an example, consider a simple program that loops from '
                '(get_length) down to zero:',
                'Next, I wrote a simple parser in Rust that could read a '
                'simple ‘programming language’ and compile it to the byte code '
                'just defined. For example, the program above can be written '
                'as:',
                'The equivalent of the example script above in this language '
                'would be the following:',
                'In the above, the ‘blit’ keyword tells the controller to send '
                'the LED strip ‘image’ created by the program (by calls to '
                'set_pixel) to the LED strip. The above program would '
                'effectively set all LEDs to yellow (RGB 255, 255, 0). The '
                'byte code for this program is as follows:',
                '17 bytes! (note that this works for strips of any length too. '
                'Nice.).',
                'Executing this code on an ESP8266 is very simply done using a '
                'for loop that iterates over the instructions, a giant switch '
                'statement that determines which instruction it is (based on '
                'the first nibble). The stack is simply an array of 32-bit '
                'integers with a separate value pointing at the last inserted '
                'item. Finally, there is a buffer for the LED data to be '
                'written to (by set_pixel). Even with this naive approach it '
                'is possible to reach a fairly high number of frames per '

                'Latin American economies between 2003 and 2017. ',
                'The piracy rate is determined by the per capita usage of '

                'The overall conclusions based on those data are quite clear. '
                'Higher piracy levels are linked to less poverty. This effect '

                'model is controlled for other variables such as unemployment '
                'and health expenditure. This means that the hypothesis that '

                'JIT can emit a single integer division instruction, just like '

                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',

                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '
                'floating-point division of two integers less than 2',
                ' and then converting the result to an integer gives the exact '
                'same result as an integer division instruction in every case. '
                "But the full range of 64 bit integers isn't representable in "
                'double precision floating point, and JavaScript numbers '
                'always have to behave as if they are represented by double '
                "precision floating point values even when that isn't true. "
                "The JIT compiler can't just do 64-bit integer math under the "
                "covers and pretend that it's floating point, because it would "
                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',
                "OK, 64-bit doesn't work, how about 16-bit and 8-bit? Well, on "
                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "
                'so bad, because CPUs add 32-bit numbers just as fast as 8-bit '
                'numbers. Where smaller types ',
                ' matter is in memory usage. If you want an array of bytes, '
                'but you use a JavaScript array to store JavaScript numbers '
                'instead, it will use 8 times the memory (and 8 times the '
                'memory bandwidth, and 8 times the cache space) because every '
                'JavaScript number is 8 bytes. Thankfully JavaScript has a '
                'solution for this too: typed arrays. Typed arrays can hold '
                '8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values in both signed and unsigned '
                "varieties. As an added benefit, since typed arrays can't hold "
                "object references, the garbage collector doesn't need to scan "
                'their contents, which also helps performance.',
                "Bonus question: what about 32-bit floating point? It's faster "

                'In 1986, the band "The Bangles" sang about "all the old '
                'paintings on the tombs" where the figures they depict are '
                '"walking like an Egyptian." Though he was neither an art '
                'historian nor an Egyptologist, songwriter Liam Sternberg was '
                'referring to one of the most striking features of ',
                ' visual art — the depiction of people, animals and objects on '
                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '
                'below.',
                '—',
                '—',
                '—',
                'Egyptian visual art used "more or less universal human '
                'approaches to representation on a flat surface," Baines '
                'said.\xa0',
                '"It [Egyptian art] influenced art in the ancient Near East," '
                'such as ancient Syrian (or Levantine) and ',
                ' art, Baines said. The same conventions can be seen in many '
                'other ancient traditions of art. ',
                ' art also uses pictorial scenes and hieroglyphic script. '
                'Although classical Greek and ',

                'from medieval Europe. As Baines explained, "It\'s a system '

                '“It is a sign of the speed at which events are moving that '
                'Hurst and Blackett’s unexpurgated edition of\xa0',
                ', published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler '
                'angle. The obvious intention of the translator’s preface and '
                'notes is to tone down the book’s ferocity and present Hitler '
                'in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was '
                'still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, '
                'and for that the property-owning classes were willing to '
                'forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in '
                'the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a '
                'version of Conservatism.',
                'Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable '
                'after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett’s '
                'edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all '
                'profits would be devoted to the Red Cross. Nevertheless, '
                'simply on the internal evidence of\xa0',
                ', it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken '
                'place in Hitler’s aims and opinions. When one compares his '
                'utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years '
                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '
                'version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have '
                'enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their '
                'peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more '
                'grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ '
                'Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and '
                'death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his '
                'feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change '
                'their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years '
                'of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the '
                'greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better '
                'an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner. '
                'Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we '

                'The year is 2008 and I had been using Mozilla Firefox for two '
                'years after my painful but inevitable breakup with Internet '
                'Explorer. But, out of school and professional necessity, I '
                'had to make the switch to Google Chrome.',
                'For the most part, it worked out for me. It had features that '
                'Firefox at the time didn’t, like being able to sync and '
                'access tabs from other devices or saving all my bookmarks '
                'under a single profile that I could transfer to other '
                'PCs.\xa0',
                'Then over the years, Google became more invasive. It, like '
                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '
                'processing power is especially a problem for laptops or other '
                'devices with very little RAM.',
                'Which is why Mozilla Firefox is such a breath of fresh air, '
                'as it uses much less of your CPU while still delivering a '
                'fast browsing experience. So feel free to have as many tabs '
                'open as you want in Firefox, your device will barely feel the '

                'trade routes, and in space trade routes aren’t much of a '

                'cheaper than the shipping costs. I imagine that the same '

                'If we could do that on Mars, we would already be doing that '

                '(3-D printed machinery) but for most applications it’s just '
                'prohibitively capital and labor intensive.',
                'Great update! Any idea how much is too much when it comes to '
                'human time spent detaching-packing-loading raptors to ship '
                'back to Earth? Seems like a good way to think about labour '
                'cost and working conditions on each planet.',
                'It is hard to imagine that if there was a shortage of Raptors '
                'at the end of the production line in a factory on Earth that '
                'the easiest and cheapest way to fix it would be to import '
                'some used ones from Mars.',
                'It’s less that I think it makes sense to ship the Raptors '
                'back, as it’s about the only thing besides scientific samples '
                'and the rare return passenger that might make sense to send '
                'back.',
                'Essentially the whole Starship aside from the engines is '
                'going to be high value parts and materials that you could use '
                'on Mars, and even the raptors might be more valuable for '
                'their material content than as engines.',
                'I can’t see shipping Raptors back to Earth as being more '
                'interesting than using the Martian Raptors for voyages to '
                'Jupiter, or further out. Mars seems like the obvious '
                'refuelling point for outer system exploration. I have no idea '
                'whether it’d make sense to go to Venus or Mercury via Mars, '
                'but Jupiter, Saturn and further out seem like they’d benefit '
                'from essentially starting with a Starship full of fuel in '
                'Martian orbit.',
                'Both fair points. I was thinking of it as a thought '
                'experiment. Now it seems likly a calculation would more '
                'reflect the assumptions in the estimates than inform about '
                'the value of a human minute on Mars.',
                'I’ve been pessimistic about medium- to long-distance '
                'transport being worthwhile on Mars, because I suspect that '
                'abrasive dust will be a much greater source of wear-and-tear '
                'on machinery than it is on our warm, moist planet.  But I '
                'like the idea of pipelines.  If titanium is much easier to '
                'extract in one place than another, it might be worth setting '
                'up an outpost and piping titanium chloride in liquid water.  '
                'Likewise for various other metals as cations, and for '
                'phosphate and sulfate.  I think most work will be done by '
                'remotely-operated semi-autonomous machinery, so that humans '
                'will need to be within a reasonable light-speed lag but not '
                'directly on-site.  Of course, I may be wrong about many '
                'implicit assumptions, such as how easy it is to insulate a '
                'pipe well enough to keep water liquid for many kilometers.',
                'I’m still guessing that it will mostly be better to process '
                'ordinary rock into differentiated materials, rather than '
                'leaving it as crushed whole rock.  I’m fairly optimistic '
                'about how easy it is to get various metals from ordinary '
                'rock.  On Earth, we have lots of kinds of ore and we have '
                'rivers and oceans that give us virtually frictionless '
                'transport on infrastructure that just exists without us '
                'having to do anything.  So of course we mine ore, and we '
                'would even if processing of ordinary whole rock into multiple '
                'useful materials were orders of magnitude easier than even I '
                'am guessing it will be.  ',
                'I’m also optimistic about the price, mass, and versatility of '
                'machinery for precision manufacturing, compared to the cost '
                'of transport to Mars, compared to the cost of producing '
                'mid-tier bulk materials on Mars, and compared to the '
                'difficulty of anticipating exactly what the Martians will '
                'need and want for the time from one launch window to the '
                'next.  So I expect anything that can be precision-machined '
                'from basic materials to be made on Mars almost from the very '
                'beginning.  Engineering and design, after all, are '
                'information, which can be shipped to Mars in minutes at '
                'essentially zero cost.',

                'securely and efficiently run code at both the edge and in the '
                'cloud to support the Internet of Things (IoT).',
                'When I refer to IoT, I am referring to devices that interface '
                'with, collect data from, and control physical things, like '
                'thermostats, solar inverters, factory equipment, medical '
                'devices, or connected cars.',
                ' IoT computing platforms are a mix of firmware and software '
                'and span everything from:',
                'Over-the-air updates for firmware and software are critical '
                'for improving IoT products over time, and applying security '
                'patches, but present a host of challenges. If the device '
                'performs safety-critical functions, like actuating power, '
                'medical equipment, or a connected car, the firmware and '
                'software cannot be updated without rigorous testing. If the '
                'device requires certification, updating it may require '
                'recertification. Updates are disruptive and need to be '
                'scheduled when the device is not performing its critical '
                'functions. Even just performing the update presents risks: if '
                'the update ends up bricking millions of devices and requires '
                'manual intervention, it could prove an existential risk to '
                'the business or the safety of individuals.',
                'As a result, edge firmware and software typically have long '
                'release cycles with significant hardware-in-the-loop testing. '
                'Firmware and software are usually bundled together and are '
                'only updated on the order of weeks or months. There is a '
                'natural reluctance to update any code at run-time given the '
                'potential for bugs and remote code execution (RCE) '
                'vulnerabilities. This makes iterating on product '
                'improvements, or quickly providing security patches, '
                'difficult.',
                'A firmware component that provides critical functions must '
                'always have a rigorous testing and release process. However, '
                'for a software component, it would provide a huge competitive '
                'advantage if it could be updated flexibly, even on-demand. '
                'Imagine the potential to iterate on a machine learning model '
                'daily, rather than every few months.',
                'This is why I find both the execution model and the security '
                'model of WebAssembly exciting. WebAssembly binaries can be '
                'very small, sometimes on the order of bytes, and they are '
                'portable across platforms. In terms of security, WebAssembly '
                'executes in a sandbox and the basic instruction set provides '
                'for nothing more than pure functions—numerical operations on '
                'its own memory. The WebAssembly code cannot read from, or '
                'write to, the file system, open ports, or access shared '
                'memory. The WebAssembly code can take advantage of functions '
                'or variables provided by the host, but only if the host '
                'provides these explicitly through imports. In other words, '
                'the host is in full control of what the WebAssembly code can '
                'do. The host can even limit the memory used or meter the '
                'number of instructions executed by the WebAssembly code. For '
                'building more complex applications that need to open ports or '
                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',
                'The adoption of WebAssembly in the cloud is limited, but it '
                'is more mature than the IoT edge. Both ',

                ', a messaging infrastructure compatible with the Kafka API, '
                'also adopted WebAssembly to run client code in event streams. '
                'For these vendors, WebAssembly is attractive because it is '
                'portable and sandboxed. Customers can write code in any '
                'language, as long as it compiles to WebAssembly, and because '
                'the vendor is running untrusted code, often in a multi-tenant '
                'environment, the strict sandboxing protects the vendor '
                'against malicious or buggy code, and helps provide tenant '

                'all the way to cloud services. I am excited about WebAssembly '
                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '

                'evaluation. In addition to this flexibility, moving '
                'computation to the edge can provide significant costs savings '
                'by taking advantage of existing edge computation, rather than '
                'consuming additional cloud resources.',
                'I have extensive experience with ',
                ', a toolkit for actor-model programming, distributed '
                'computing, and streaming data. Akka has been a wonderful '
                'platform for building reliable and scalable services for IoT. '
                'With Akka, the run-time is abstracted from the developer. The '
                'developer writes pure functions that are then composed into '
                'actors or streams. For actors, the run-time handles '
                'concurrency, distribution, location transparency, and '
                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '
                'binary, when all the developer is really concerned about is '
                'writing the business logic associated with each route. As a '
                'result, developers end up maintaining a lot of boilerplate '
                'and framework code.',
                'To demonstrate the challenge, consider hundreds of services '
                'using an HTTP server compiled into the application binary. '
                'There are likely many different versions depending on when '
                'the application was last compiled and deployed. If there is a '
                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '
                'logic? This would be similar to how host operating systems '
                'can be patched underneath Kubernetes and no one needs to '
                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '
                'model, but with even less boilerplate and richer primitives '
                'for handling messaging, dynamics, failure, and state. '
                'WebAssembly holds a lot of promise in being able to separate '
                'the run-time environment from the business logic and there '
                'are a few platforms evolving in this direction.',
                ' is a means of running WebAssembly on Kubernetes. Because '
                'WebAssembly has small binaries that can be downloaded quickly '
                'and run efficiently without a lot of start-up overhead, it is '
                'attractive for serverless functions.',
                '  ',

                ' can run actors and it also has capability providers for '
                'messaging and interfacing with relational databases and '
                'key-values stores.',
                ' wasmCloud looks the most like what I am familiar with with '
                'Akka, where it is easy to model IoT devices with actors. One '
                'thing I would not want to lose with any of these models is '
                'type safety and there needs to be system-wide type checking '
                'that can be performed statically, not just at run-time.',

                'It is still early days for WebAssembly on the edge and in the '

                ', ',
                ', ',
                ', and others, all seem like viable options that can be used '
                'as a library from various programming languages. WebAssembly '
                'is portable across run-times, but changing from one host '
                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '
                'portable way, WASI, or another standard built on top of WASI, '
                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '
                'machine. Python, however, feels awkward. If my understanding '
                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '
                'from a language that is strongly typed, supports functional '
                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '
                'language for any new development.',
                'Finally, if your application must take advantage of multiple '
                'cores, support for multi-threading in library run-times is '
                'still new and limited. That said, for many applications, like '
                'numerical computation, WebAssembly is very fast and runs with '
                'native performance. The performance is also very predictable '
                'since there is no garbage collection. Most run-times also '
                'have support for Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) '
                'which use the processor more efficiently for repetitive '
                'calculations on large data sets. For the majority of the '
                'applications I am looking at, multi-threading should not be a '
                'major limitation, and WebAssembly should deliver excellent '
                'and efficient performance.',
                'WebAssembly is portable, can be targeted from multiple '
                'programming languages, has small binaries, runs efficiently, '
                'and has a very strict sandboxing model. This makes it '
                'exciting for IoT:',
                'Why am I excited about WebAssembly? I have not used '
                'WebAssembly in a product, so I am not speaking from direct '
                'experience, but I am excited about WebAssembly for IoT, for '
                'both the edge and the cloud, and for a more flexible '

                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',
                'Ideally, we would like to send short ‘animations’ or videos '
                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '
                'where the last nibble determines the number of bytes to pop '
                '(conveniently making ‘0x00’ a no-operation). Similary, ‘0x11’ '
                'means ‘push a single byte’ (the byte to be pushed is the next '
                'byte in the code stream), 0x32 means ‘push the next 8 bytes '
                'as two integers’, et cetera. There are also operators (0x8• '
                'are binary operators, e.g. 0x80 is ‘add’ and 0x81 is '
                '‘subtract’) and jump instructions. Finally there are special '
                'instructions that push the length of the LED strip to the '
                'stack (0xe0 = get_length) and to set a pixel (0xe3 = '
                'set_pixel). ',
                'As an example, consider a simple program that loops from '
                '(get_length) down to zero:',
                'Next, I wrote a simple parser in Rust that could read a '
                'simple ‘programming language’ and compile it to the byte code '
                'just defined. For example, the program above can be written '
                'as:',
                'The equivalent of the example script above in this language '
                'would be the following:',
                'In the above, the ‘blit’ keyword tells the controller to send '
                'the LED strip ‘image’ created by the program (by calls to '
                'set_pixel) to the LED strip. The above program would '
                'effectively set all LEDs to yellow (RGB 255, 255, 0). The '
                'byte code for this program is as follows:',
                '17 bytes! (note that this works for strips of any length too. '
                'Nice.).',
                'Executing this code on an ESP8266 is very simply done using a '
                'for loop that iterates over the instructions, a giant switch '
                'statement that determines which instruction it is (based on '
                'the first nibble). The stack is simply an array of 32-bit '
                'integers with a separate value pointing at the last inserted '
                'item. Finally, there is a buffer for the LED data to be '
                'written to (by set_pixel). Even with this naive approach it '
                'is possible to reach a fairly high number of frames per '
                'second (of course depending on the amount of instructions '
                'that need to run between each frame). Currently this part is '

                'But sadly, there are lots of lonely or socially isolated '
                'people. And if the human brain did indeed develop for social '
                'interaction, then we should anticipate this to have a '
                'substantial impact.',
                'A recent study published in Neurology indicates that social '
                'isolation increases the risk of dementia in older people and '
                'is as well associated with changes in brain structure and '
                'cognition, which is the mental process of learning.',
                'The social brain hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the '

                'interactions, is already well supported by a large body of '
                'research.',
                'In one investigation, the social interaction-related brain '
                'areas of almost 7,000 individuals were mapped. It '
                'demonstrated a strong relationship between brain regions '
                'consistently involved in various social interactions and '
                'networks that underpin cognition.',
                'This also includes the default mode network – active when we '
                'are not paying attention to the outside world, the salience '
                'network, the subcortical network, which is involved in '
                'memory, emotion and motivation as well as the central '
                'executive network, which enables us to regulate our emotions.',
                'The goal of this research is to learn more about the impact '
                'of social isolation on grey matter, which is made up of '
                'neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from '
                'the UK Biobank which contains information on nearly 500,000 '
                'individuals with an average age of 57 was used.',
                'Socially isolated as defined in this case is\xa0 a person who '
                'lived alone, interacted with other people less frequently '
                'than once a month and engaged in social activities less '
                'frequently than once a week.',
                'Approximately 32,000 individuals’ neuroimaging (MRI) results '
                'were also included in the study. This demonstrated that those '
                'who are socially isolated have lower levels of cognition, '
                'including memory and reaction time as well as less grey '
                'matter in several areas of the brain.',
                'These regions included the hippocampus, which is a crucial '
                'area involved in learning and memory that is typically '
                'disrupted early in Alzheimer’s illness, the temporal region, '

                'impact on the brain.',
                'However, it is evident that if one is alone or lonely, the '
                'person may have chronic stress. This has a significant effect '
                'on both his or her physical and mental wellbeing.',
                'Another aspect might be that an individual\xa0loses some of '

                'ability to use language and other cognitive functions like '
                'attention and memory will decline.',
                'Also, due to the fact that memory and attention are essential '

                'A national poll on loneliness conducted in 2019 found that '
                'living alone or far from family members increased the chance '
                'of loneliness. People who are unsatisfied with their social '
                'and family\xa0lives are also more likely to say they are '
                'lonely than people who are not.',
                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '
                'exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few '
                'examples of factors that keep people from socializing and '
                'connecting with others.',
                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '
                'loneliness and health comes from studies examining mortality '
                'as an outcome. A considerable body of evidence has '
                'accumulated over the last four decades, consisting of ',
                ' and hundreds of large-scale prospective epidemiological '
                'investigations.',
                'According to this data, having a strong social network '
                'greatly lowers the probability of dying young from any cause. '
                'By way of illustration, a meta-analysis of 148 prospective '
                'studies discovered that social connection (averaged across a '

                'apps like Sketch, MLB, and NordVPN.\xa0',
                'I currently divide my subscriptions into three categories. '
                'The first are apps that, if I stopped paying for them, I '
                'would 1) lose access to (e.g. Disney+, Audm, etc.), or 2) '
                'would severely curtail their functionality (e.g. Day One, '
                'Grammarly). The second category is apps that I purchased '
                'outright and have a hybrid approach where they receive '
                'updates for a while (e.g. one year) after purchase. For these '
                'apps, receiving new updates and features requires purchasing '
                'another year of updates, but most existing features prior to '
                'that date remain fully functional. Apps like Agenda, Nova, & '
                'CleanShot X follow this model. And finally, the third '
                'category is subscription applications I purchased a lifetime '
                'license for. This tier is often 2-5x the cost of an annual '
                'subscription, but it gives me access to the app and all its '
                'features for as long as it is supported. Apps like Calm, '

                'Piracy is a controversial topic and research into the effects '
                'of copyright infringement is widely debated as well. A new '
                'academic study adds an interesting angle by suggesting that '
                'software piracy might lower poverty. While this is a '
                'plausible conclusion, there could actually be more factors at '
                'play.\n',
                'When copyright holders discuss online piracy, they often '
                'highlight the associated losses. However, not all pirated '
                'downloads equal a loss.',
                'While there is certainly a group of pirates who simply refuse '
                'to pay for content, there are also people who simply can’t '
                'afford it. ',
                'This is particularly true for software, which can be rather '
                'pricey. Interestingly, software piracy can also open up a '
                'door to escape from poverty. Mastering coding or editing '
                'skills, for example, allows people to start a business or '
                'join the workforce. ',
                'The Internet is ',
                ' of top designers who started with a piece of pirated '
                'software, mastered their skills, and went on to become a '
                'professional. This raises the question: can software piracy '
                'mitigate poverty?',
                'A ',
                ' published in the Balkan Journal of Social Sciences tries to '
                'provide some insight into the matter. The researchers examine '
                'the effect of software piracy on poverty in developing and '
                'Latin American economies between 2003 and 2017. ',
                'The piracy rate is determined by the per capita usage of '
                'pirated software or the claimed losses. Poverty is measured '
                'through six indicators including the percentage of the '
                'population living below the poverty threshold. ',
                'The overall conclusions based on those data are quite clear. '
                'Higher piracy levels are linked to less poverty. This effect '
                'is consistent and statistically significant for all six '
                'poverty indicators. ',
                '“[T]here is a statistically significant reverse relationship '
                'between usage of pirated software and poverty in all six '
                'poverty models for both developing and Latin American '
                'countries samples,” the researchers write.',
                'This link between piracy and poverty remains intact when the '
                'model is controlled for other variables such as unemployment '
                'and health expenditure. This means that the hypothesis that '
                '“increases in usage of pirated software decrease poverty” '
                'seems likely. ',
                'As highlighted earlier, it would make sense to find such an '
                'effect. That said, the methodology section of the paper is '
                'rather short and there is no discussion section that '
                'elaborates on the findings. However, people should always be '
                'cautious to explain such links as causal effects. ',
                'If we frame the research question the other way around, the '
                'results could also make sense. In other words, does a '
                'decrease in poverty lead to more software piracy?',
                'It’s not hard to imagine that people living far below the '
                'poverty line aren’t particularly concerned with downloading '
                'copies of Photoshop. However, as poverty decreases, they '
                'might be able to buy a computer, which undoubtedly increases '
                'their likelihood of pirating anything at all. ',
                'So perhaps software piracy lowers poverty, while lower '
                'poverty also leads to more piracy. This flywheel effect may '
                'explain the significant results and could be particularly '
                'strong in developing countries.',
                'The paper doesn’t mention this reverse relationship but it '
                'wouldn’t be a surprise if it plays a role here. '
                'Unfortunately, the researchers didn’t respond to our request '
                'for comment, but it might be worth a follow-up study.',

                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '
                'version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have '
                'enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their '
                'peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more '
                'grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ '
                'Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and '
                'death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his '
                'feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change '
                'their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years '
                'of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the '
                'greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better '
                'an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner. '
                'Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we '

                'In 1986, the band "The Bangles" sang about "all the old '
                'paintings on the tombs" where the figures they depict are '
                '"walking like an Egyptian." Though he was neither an art '
                'historian nor an Egyptologist, songwriter Liam Sternberg was '
                'referring to one of the most striking features of ',
                ' visual art — the depiction of people, animals and objects on '
                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '
                'below.',

                'Egyptian visual art used "more or less universal human '
                'approaches to representation on a flat surface," Baines '
                'said.\xa0',
                '"It [Egyptian art] influenced art in the ancient Near East," '
                'such as ancient Syrian (or Levantine) and ',

                'JIT can emit a single integer division instruction, just like '

                "All of JavaScript's bitwise operators inherited from C "
                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',
                ' after your arithmetic operations, and for unsigned you use ',
                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '
                'floating-point division of two integers less than 2',
                ' and then converting the result to an integer gives the exact '
                'same result as an integer division instruction in every case. '
                "But the full range of 64 bit integers isn't representable in "
                'double precision floating point, and JavaScript numbers '
                'always have to behave as if they are represented by double '
                "precision floating point values even when that isn't true. "
                "The JIT compiler can't just do 64-bit integer math under the "
                "covers and pretend that it's floating point, because it would "
                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',
                "OK, 64-bit doesn't work, how about 16-bit and 8-bit? Well, on "
                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "
                'so bad, because CPUs add 32-bit numbers just as fast as 8-bit '
                'numbers. Where smaller types ',
                ' matter is in memory usage. If you want an array of bytes, '
                'but you use a JavaScript array to store JavaScript numbers '
                'instead, it will use 8 times the memory (and 8 times the '
                'memory bandwidth, and 8 times the cache space) because every '
                'JavaScript number is 8 bytes. Thankfully JavaScript has a '
                'solution for this too: typed arrays. Typed arrays can hold '
                '8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values in both signed and unsigned '
                "varieties. As an added benefit, since typed arrays can't hold "
                "object references, the garbage collector doesn't need to scan "
                'their contents, which also helps performance.',
                "Bonus question: what about 32-bit floating point? It's faster "
                'than 64-bit floating point, and used a lot in 3D graphics. '
                'Can we use a similar trick to make the JavaScript JIT emit '
                "32-bit float math instructions? The answer is yes, there's a "
                'function ',

                'transport cost of $200/kg, the results do not vary much even '
                'as this changes. Commodities split into three categories: raw '

                'can be made from water, Mars atmosphere, or surface rocks '
                'must always be made locally. Anything simpler than textiles '
                'is profitable to produce on Mars. And anything requiring '

                'economic driver to produce, eg, bearings and motors on Mars. '

                'securely and efficiently run code at both the edge and in the '
                'cloud to support the Internet of Things (IoT).',
                'When I refer to IoT, I am referring to devices that interface '
                'with, collect data from, and control physical things, like '
                'thermostats, solar inverters, factory equipment, medical '
                'devices, or connected cars.',
                ' IoT computing platforms are a mix of firmware and software '
                'and span everything from:',
                'Over-the-air updates for firmware and software are critical '
                'for improving IoT products over time, and applying security '
                'patches, but present a host of challenges. If the device '
                'performs safety-critical functions, like actuating power, '
                'medical equipment, or a connected car, the firmware and '
                'software cannot be updated without rigorous testing. If the '
                'device requires certification, updating it may require '
                'recertification. Updates are disruptive and need to be '
                'scheduled when the device is not performing its critical '
                'functions. Even just performing the update presents risks: if '
                'the update ends up bricking millions of devices and requires '
                'manual intervention, it could prove an existential risk to '
                'the business or the safety of individuals.',
                'As a result, edge firmware and software typically have long '
                'release cycles with significant hardware-in-the-loop testing. '
                'Firmware and software are usually bundled together and are '
                'only updated on the order of weeks or months. There is a '
                'natural reluctance to update any code at run-time given the '
                'potential for bugs and remote code execution (RCE) '
                'vulnerabilities. This makes iterating on product '
                'improvements, or quickly providing security patches, '
                'difficult.',
                'A firmware component that provides critical functions must '
                'always have a rigorous testing and release process. However, '
                'for a software component, it would provide a huge competitive '
                'advantage if it could be updated flexibly, even on-demand. '
                'Imagine the potential to iterate on a machine learning model '
                'daily, rather than every few months.',
                'This is why I find both the execution model and the security '
                'model of WebAssembly exciting. WebAssembly binaries can be '
                'very small, sometimes on the order of bytes, and they are '
                'portable across platforms. In terms of security, WebAssembly '
                'executes in a sandbox and the basic instruction set provides '
                'for nothing more than pure functions—numerical operations on '
                'its own memory. The WebAssembly code cannot read from, or '
                'write to, the file system, open ports, or access shared '
                'memory. The WebAssembly code can take advantage of functions '
                'or variables provided by the host, but only if the host '
                'provides these explicitly through imports. In other words, '
                'the host is in full control of what the WebAssembly code can '
                'do. The host can even limit the memory used or meter the '
                'number of instructions executed by the WebAssembly code. For '
                'building more complex applications that need to open ports or '
                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',
                'The adoption of WebAssembly in the cloud is limited, but it '
                'is more mature than the IoT edge. Both ',
                ' and ',

                ', a messaging infrastructure compatible with the Kafka API, '
                'also adopted WebAssembly to run client code in event streams. '
                'For these vendors, WebAssembly is attractive because it is '
                'portable and sandboxed. Customers can write code in any '
                'language, as long as it compiles to WebAssembly, and because '
                'the vendor is running untrusted code, often in a multi-tenant '
                'environment, the strict sandboxing protects the vendor '
                'against malicious or buggy code, and helps provide tenant '
                'isolation. Cloudflare and Redpanda both use ',

                'In my work, I am not as concerned with running untrusted code '
                'because the software is vertically integrated from firmware '
                'all the way to cloud services. I am excited about WebAssembly '
                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '
                'developer for productivity, portability, and security.',
                'The ability to move computation from the cloud to the edge is '
                'revolutionary. Computation can be developed, tested, and '
                'benchmarked in the cloud using historical data stored in the '
                'cloud, simulated data, or live data streamed or queried from '
                'the IoT device. When you are satisfied with the results, the '
                'code can be moved from the cloud to the edge.',
                ' WebAssembly binaries are small, so they can be stored as '
                'configuration and synchronized to the IoT devices using '
                'existing mechanisms for desired-state configuration '
                'management. This makes it possible  to iterate on edge '
                'computation, reliably and securely, in hours or days, rather '
                'than weeks or months. Even experimental computation, for '
                'example, a new machine learning model, can run at the edge in '
                'shadow mode and report results back to the cloud for '
                'evaluation. In addition to this flexibility, moving '
                'computation to the edge can provide significant costs savings '
                'by taking advantage of existing edge computation, rather than '
                'consuming additional cloud resources.',

                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '
                'binary, when all the developer is really concerned about is '
                'writing the business logic associated with each route. As a '
                'result, developers end up maintaining a lot of boilerplate '
                'and framework code.',
                'To demonstrate the challenge, consider hundreds of services '
                'using an HTTP server compiled into the application binary. '
                'There are likely many different versions depending on when '
                'the application was last compiled and deployed. If there is a '
                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '
                'logic? This would be similar to how host operating systems '
                'can be patched underneath Kubernetes and no one needs to '
                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '
                'model, but with even less boilerplate and richer primitives '
                'for handling messaging, dynamics, failure, and state. '
                'WebAssembly holds a lot of promise in being able to separate '
                'the run-time environment from the business logic and there '
                'are a few platforms evolving in this direction.',
                ' is a means of running WebAssembly on Kubernetes. Because '
                'WebAssembly has small binaries that can be downloaded quickly '
                'and run efficiently without a lot of start-up overhead, it is '
                'attractive for serverless functions.',

                ' wasmCloud looks the most like what I am familiar with with '
                'Akka, where it is easy to model IoT devices with actors. One '
                'thing I would not want to lose with any of these models is '
                'type safety and there needs to be system-wide type checking '
                'that can be performed statically, not just at run-time.',

                ', ',
                ', ',
                ', and others, all seem like viable options that can be used '
                'as a library from various programming languages. WebAssembly '
                'is portable across run-times, but changing from one host '
                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '
                'portable way, WASI, or another standard built on top of WASI, '
                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '
                'machine. Python, however, feels awkward. If my understanding '
                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '
                'from a language that is strongly typed, supports functional '
                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '
                'language for any new development.',
                'Finally, if your application must take advantage of multiple '
                'cores, support for multi-threading in library run-times is '
                'still new and limited. That said, for many applications, like '
                'numerical computation, WebAssembly is very fast and runs with '
                'native performance. The performance is also very predictable '
                'since there is no garbage collection. Most run-times also '
                'have support for Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) '
                'which use the processor more efficiently for repetitive '
                'calculations on large data sets. For the majority of the '
                'applications I am looking at, multi-threading should not be a '
                'major limitation, and WebAssembly should deliver excellent '
                'and efficient performance.',
                'WebAssembly is portable, can be targeted from multiple '
                'programming languages, has small binaries, runs efficiently, '
                'and has a very strict sandboxing model. This makes it '
                'exciting for IoT:',
                'Why am I excited about WebAssembly? I have not used '
                'WebAssembly in a product, so I am not speaking from direct '

                'both the edge and the cloud, and for a more flexible '

                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '
                'processing power is especially a problem for laptops or other '
                'devices with very little RAM.',
                'Which is why Mozilla Firefox is such a breath of fresh air, '
                'as it uses much less of your CPU while still delivering a '
                'fast browsing experience. So feel free to have as many tabs '
                'open as you want in Firefox, your device will barely feel the '

                '. In it, I said that when people like a new programming '
                'language, they judge it from a biased perspective because new '
                'things get used for new development, whereas the older things '

                'think the fascinating thing is how similar their developer '
                'tooling experience is. They both have a modern, '
                'batteries-included take on development that is very different '
                'from many of the languages in the DREAD list. You don’t need '
                'to wonder what the best tool to use for testing, fuzzing, '
                'packaging, or linting is. All of these things are '

                'to do with the specifics of the language syntax. Instead, the '
                'difference is the tooling and supporting ecosystem.',
                'My thesis is that the tooling and developer experience for '
                'programming languages is improving over time, but mainly in '
                'new languages. It goes like this: Tooling innovation happens, '
                'new languages adopt and standardize on it, and end up '

                'I’m not sure whether it’s a blessing or a curse, but '
                'expansive standard libraries [are a big improvement]. It’s '
                'possible to get a lot done with PHP, Python, and Go without '
                'needing to install any third-party library. They come with '
                'json, http client and server, and even database access for '

                ', but both feel very minimal compared to the common '
                'conception of a batteries-included standard library.',
                'The history is a little unclear to me, but it seems like '
                'Python (1991) was the first language to take the stance of '
                'really having an extensive standard library. Java 1.0 (1996) '
                'also came with an extensive standard library (The Java Class '
                'Library), and many other languages would follow suit.',
                'It’s hard to overstate the benefits of getting simple things '

                'having to reach for third-party dependencies.',
                'Most modern languages (that aren’t JavaScript) now ship with '
                'extensive standard libraries. In particular, though, Go puts '
                'special emphasis on its standard library. It promises '
                'backward compatibility, performance, and well-thought-out '
                'implementations. Because of this, Go developers lean on the '
                'standard library more than many other communities and '

                'Eventually, you outstrip even the most inclusive of standard '

                'it’s fair to say that people who used and contributed to CPAN '
                'knew it was a game-changer.',
                'CPAN was launched in 1995 (based on CTAN), and by its height '
                'in 2003, it had established a new way for people to get '
                'things done with software. That is gluing together '
                'third-party components. So much of modern development now '
                'follows this model.',
                'It’s hard to find a commonly used programming language '
                'created after 2003 that didn’t come with a third-party '
                'package repository of some sort. CPAN moved the line so that '
                'from then forward, a “real” programming language needed to '
                'have a strategy for third-party package management.',
                'Ok, so you might wonder, if CPAN made Perl better and every '
                'language moving forward embraced package managers for '
                'third-party code, why didn’t languages predating this add on '
                'package managers after the fact?',
                'Well, they did, but it doesn’t seem obvious how to get '
                'agreement in a language community after a certain point. I’m '
                'not sure why this is, but maybe people don’t like change?',
                'This is going to be a running theme. Once the idioms and '
                'patterns of a programming language, and a language community, '
                'have been established its hard to go back and add things on. '
                'At least I think this is why Javascript has NPM, Rust has '
                'crates but C++ has ',
                '. You know what is better than one universally agreed upon '
                'package manager? Not eight of them!',
                'One counter point on backporting here though is standard '
                'libraries. C++ added its standard library rather late in the '
                'game, by successfully bringing parts of STL under its roof. '
                'So existing languages can adopt tooling innovations, its just '
                'a bigger lift.',
                'So after CPAN, a great standard library that does most of the '
                'things you need to do, augmented with a third-party package '
                'repository that is simple to use and straight forward to '
                'contribute to became the table stakes for a language.',
                'Once you have third-party packages, you need an easy way to '
                'document them. Javadoc and it’s generated documentation was '
                'the first version of this I encountered. It made it much '

                'controlled individually, which makes them really versatile '
                'for use in e.g. home automation. Throughout my home there are '
                'several strips, each adapting their hue to the current time '
                'of day and showing all sorts of information, such as the '
                'current time and rain forecasts using radar data fetched '
                'online. Pretty neat! But how do you get these strips to show '
                'more than just a solid color (i.e. visual effects or '
                'animations), and actually use them as ‘dashboards’ in a '
                'scalable and maintainable way? In this project, I start out '
                'with a simple and robust (but not very powerful) solution, '
                'and end up with a ',
                ' over-engineered, but very flexible solution to this problem '
                'involving a custom programming language and bytecode '
                'instruction set.',
                'The recommended approach for controlling LED strips like this '
                'is by using ',
                '. ESPHome is a service that allows you to compile custom '
                'firmware for ESP8266, which can control LED strips (among '
                'many other things!) and allows for easy integration with ',
                '. The main benefit of ESPHome is easy device management: '
                'remote updating and reconfiguration is fully automated. '
                'Swapping out a broken ESP8266 or board is as easy as '
                'downloading the right firmware image from ESPHome, flashing '
                'it over USB, and swapping the hardware. The ESPHome firmware '
                'allows color and brightness to be set (from e.g. Home '
                'Assistant) for all LEDs at the same time. One way to make an '
                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',
                'Ideally, we would like to send short ‘animations’ or videos '
                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '
                'where the last nibble determines the number of bytes to pop '
                '(conveniently making ‘0x00’ a no-operation). Similary, ‘0x11’ '
                'means ‘push a single byte’ (the byte to be pushed is the next '
                'byte in the code stream), 0x32 means ‘push the next 8 bytes '
                'as two integers’, et cetera. There are also operators (0x8• '
                'are binary operators, e.g. 0x80 is ‘add’ and 0x81 is '
                '‘subtract’) and jump instructions. Finally there are special '
                'instructions that push the length of the LED strip to the '
                'stack (0xe0 = get_length) and to set a pixel (0xe3 = '
                'set_pixel). ',
                'As an example, consider a simple program that loops from '
                '(get_length) down to zero:',
                'Next, I wrote a simple parser in Rust that could read a '
                'simple ‘programming language’ and compile it to the byte code '
                'just defined. For example, the program above can be written '
                'as:',
                'The equivalent of the example script above in this language '
                'would be the following:',
                'In the above, the ‘blit’ keyword tells the controller to send '
                'the LED strip ‘image’ created by the program (by calls to '
                'set_pixel) to the LED strip. The above program would '
                'effectively set all LEDs to yellow (RGB 255, 255, 0). The '
                'byte code for this program is as follows:',
                '17 bytes! (note that this works for strips of any length too. '
                'Nice.).',
                'Executing this code on an ESP8266 is very simply done using a '
                'for loop that iterates over the instructions, a giant switch '
                'statement that determines which instruction it is (based on '
                'the first nibble). The stack is simply an array of 32-bit '
                'integers with a separate value pointing at the last inserted '
                'item. Finally, there is a buffer for the LED data to be '
                'written to (by set_pixel). Even with this naive approach it '
                'is possible to reach a fairly high number of frames per '

                'memory, emotion and motivation as well as the central '

                'of social isolation on grey matter, which is made up of '
                'neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from '
                'the UK Biobank which contains information on nearly 500,000 '
                'individuals with an average age of 57 was used.',

                'Approximately 32,000 individuals’ neuroimaging (MRI) results '
                'were also included in the study. This demonstrated that those '

                'including memory and reaction time as well as less grey '
                'matter in several areas of the brain.',
                'These regions included the hippocampus, which is a crucial '

                'A national poll on loneliness conducted in 2019 found that '
                'living alone or far from family members increased the chance '
                'of loneliness. People who are unsatisfied with their social '
                'and family\xa0lives are also more likely to say they are '
                'lonely than people who are not.',
                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '
                'exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few '
                'examples of factors that keep people from socializing and '
                'connecting with others.',
                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '
                'loneliness and health comes from studies examining mortality '
                'as an outcome. A considerable body of evidence has '

                'According to this data, having a strong social network '
                'greatly lowers the probability of dying young from any cause. '
                'By way of illustration, a meta-analysis of 148 prospective '
                'studies discovered that social connection (averaged across a '

                'coffees and meals significantly adds up across days, weeks, '
                'and months.',
                'I recently applied the same principle to my subscriptions. '
                'Over the past several years, as more and more apps have moved '
                'from standalone releases to yearly subscription pricing, the '
                'drip of yearly costs continues to accrue. What I find '

                'habituate to it, the monthly fees becoming just another '
                'expense in the litany of other costs that are part of '

                "So this isn't a repudiation of subscription models; more an "
                'experiment to 1) become more aware of what I was spending and '
                '2) assess whether I was happy with the value I was getting '

                'apps like Sketch, MLB, and NordVPN.\xa0',
                'I currently divide my subscriptions into three categories. '
                'The first are apps that, if I stopped paying for them, I '
                'would 1) lose access to (e.g. Disney+, Audm, etc.), or 2) '
                'would severely curtail their functionality (e.g. Day One, '

                'outright and have a hybrid approach where they receive '

                'another year of updates, but most existing features prior to '
                'that date remain fully functional. Apps like Agenda, Nova, & '
                'CleanShot X follow this model. And finally, the third '
                'category is subscription applications I purchased a lifetime '
                'license for. This tier is often 2-5x the cost of an annual '

                'Piracy is a controversial topic and research into the effects '
                'of copyright infringement is widely debated as well. A new '
                'academic study adds an interesting angle by suggesting that '
                'software piracy might lower poverty. While this is a '
                'plausible conclusion, there could actually be more factors at '
                'play.\n',
                'When copyright holders discuss online piracy, they often '
                'highlight the associated losses. However, not all pirated '
                'downloads equal a loss.',
                'While there is certainly a group of pirates who simply refuse '
                'to pay for content, there are also people who simply can’t '
                'afford it. ',
                'This is particularly true for software, which can be rather '
                'pricey. Interestingly, software piracy can also open up a '
                'door to escape from poverty. Mastering coding or editing '
                'skills, for example, allows people to start a business or '
                'join the workforce. ',
                'The Internet is ',
                ' of top designers who started with a piece of pirated '
                'software, mastered their skills, and went on to become a '
                'professional. This raises the question: can software piracy '
                'mitigate poverty?',
                'A ',
                ' published in the Balkan Journal of Social Sciences tries to '
                'provide some insight into the matter. The researchers examine '
                'the effect of software piracy on poverty in developing and '
                'Latin American economies between 2003 and 2017. ',
                'The piracy rate is determined by the per capita usage of '
                'pirated software or the claimed losses. Poverty is measured '
                'through six indicators including the percentage of the '
                'population living below the poverty threshold. ',
                'The overall conclusions based on those data are quite clear. '
                'Higher piracy levels are linked to less poverty. This effect '
                'is consistent and statistically significant for all six '
                'poverty indicators. ',
                '“[T]here is a statistically significant reverse relationship '
                'between usage of pirated software and poverty in all six '
                'poverty models for both developing and Latin American '
                'countries samples,” the researchers write.',
                'This link between piracy and poverty remains intact when the '
                'model is controlled for other variables such as unemployment '
                'and health expenditure. This means that the hypothesis that '
                '“increases in usage of pirated software decrease poverty” '
                'seems likely. ',
                'As highlighted earlier, it would make sense to find such an '
                'effect. That said, the methodology section of the paper is '
                'rather short and there is no discussion section that '
                'elaborates on the findings. However, people should always be '
                'cautious to explain such links as causal effects. ',
                'If we frame the research question the other way around, the '
                'results could also make sense. In other words, does a '
                'decrease in poverty lead to more software piracy?',
                'It’s not hard to imagine that people living far below the '
                'poverty line aren’t particularly concerned with downloading '
                'copies of Photoshop. However, as poverty decreases, they '
                'might be able to buy a computer, which undoubtedly increases '
                'their likelihood of pirating anything at all. ',
                'So perhaps software piracy lowers poverty, while lower '
                'poverty also leads to more piracy. This flywheel effect may '
                'explain the significant results and could be particularly '
                'strong in developing countries.',
                'The paper doesn’t mention this reverse relationship but it '
                'wouldn’t be a surprise if it plays a role here. '
                'Unfortunately, the researchers didn’t respond to our request '
                'for comment, but it might be worth a follow-up study.',

                'Hurst and Blackett’s unexpurgated edition of\xa0',
                ', published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler '
                'angle. The obvious intention of the translator’s preface and '
                'notes is to tone down the book’s ferocity and present Hitler '
                'in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was '
                'still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, '
                'and for that the property-owning classes were willing to '
                'forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in '
                'the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a '
                'version of Conservatism.',
                'Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable '
                'after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett’s '
                'edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all '
                'profits would be devoted to the Red Cross. Nevertheless, '
                'simply on the internal evidence of\xa0',
                ', it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken '
                'place in Hitler’s aims and opinions. When one compares his '
                'utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years '
                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '
                'version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have '
                'enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their '
                'peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more '
                'grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ '
                'Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and '
                'death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his '
                'feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change '
                'their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years '
                'of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the '
                'greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better '
                'an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner. '

                '. Unfortunately, it makes things slow. Doubles take a lot of '

                'code to JavaScript, because existing code usually expects to '

                'JavaScript turns out to have a full set of bit manipulation '
                'instructions. The bitwise and/or/xor/not/shift operators are '
                'just like C, and I have no idea why JavaScript originally had '
                "them because they don't seem very useful for web development. "
                "Also that's weird when all numbers are double precision "

                'floating point numbers. And neither does JavaScript. In fact, '
                'JavaScript will (conceptually) first round your 64-bit double '
                'to a 32-bit signed integer, do the bitwise operation, and '
                'then convert it back to a double precision value. Weird!',
                'All this conversion sounds expensive! And it probably was, '
                'back in the days before ',
                '. The asm.js people were porting C code to JavaScript, and '
                "the weird casting performed by JavaScript's weird bitwise "
                "operators was just what they needed to emulate C's integer "

                'In C if ',
                ' and ',
                ' are integers then ',
                ' will do integer division, rounding the result down. In '
                'JavaScript ',
                ' will always be a floating point division with a floating '
                'point result. But if you apply a bitwise operator right '
                'afterward, then the result will be rounded down, converted to '
                "integer, and you'll get the same number as C did! With a lot "
                "more work. Of course you don't want your bitwise operator to "
                'change the result, so you can do a no-op bitwise operation '
                'such as ',
                ' or ',

                ' instruction since it does nothing. But the real work is in '
                'all that slow conversion to and from floating point. It turns '
                'out that if you add a ',
                ' after every operation, your JavaScript JIT compiler can skip '
                'the redundant conversions too, and just keep your numbers as '
                'integers the whole time. When the inputs to a division are '
                'known to be integers, and ',
                ' converts it to integer again afterward, then instead of '
                'emitting two conversions to floating point, a floating point '
                'division instruction, and then a conversion to integer, the '
                'JIT can emit a single integer division instruction, just like '
                'a C compiler would. This is pretty miraculous!',
                "All of JavaScript's bitwise operators inherited from C "
                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',
                ' after your arithmetic operations, and for unsigned you use ',
                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '
                'floating-point division of two integers less than 2',
                ' and then converting the result to an integer gives the exact '
                'same result as an integer division instruction in every case. '
                "But the full range of 64 bit integers isn't representable in "
                'double precision floating point, and JavaScript numbers '
                'always have to behave as if they are represented by double '
                "precision floating point values even when that isn't true. "
                "The JIT compiler can't just do 64-bit integer math under the "
                "covers and pretend that it's floating point, because it would "
                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',
                "OK, 64-bit doesn't work, how about 16-bit and 8-bit? Well, on "
                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "
                'so bad, because CPUs add 32-bit numbers just as fast as 8-bit '
                'numbers. Where smaller types ',
                ' matter is in memory usage. If you want an array of bytes, '
                'but you use a JavaScript array to store JavaScript numbers '
                'instead, it will use 8 times the memory (and 8 times the '
                'memory bandwidth, and 8 times the cache space) because every '
                'JavaScript number is 8 bytes. Thankfully JavaScript has a '
                'solution for this too: typed arrays. Typed arrays can hold '
                '8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values in both signed and unsigned '
                "varieties. As an added benefit, since typed arrays can't hold "
                "object references, the garbage collector doesn't need to scan "
                'their contents, which also helps performance.',
                "Bonus question: what about 32-bit floating point? It's faster "
                'than 64-bit floating point, and used a lot in 3D graphics. '
                'Can we use a similar trick to make the JavaScript JIT emit '
                "32-bit float math instructions? The answer is yes, there's a "
                'function ',
                " used for this purpose by asm.js. I've never tried using it "

                'topic here to have another go and to help future readers, '
                'including me, get quantitative on this subject.',
                'There are three intuitions which underlie this discussion. ',
                'A less terrible version of the diagram is given below.',
                'The diagram shows a mix of industrial sectors (eg all steel) '
                'and also particular products as representatives of entire '
                'sectors (beyond burger for highly processed food). These '
                'products are graphed according to their annual ',
                ' consumption (horizontal axis) and annual ',
                ' cost (vertical axis). On the far right we have water, which '
                'is incredibly cheap despite us using far more of it than '
                'anything else. As we trend to the left, we traverse steadily '
                'more sophisticated products with higher unit costs and lower '
                'production volumes. ',
                'On Mars, manufacturing costs will be higher and consumption '
                'patterns quite different. In particular, Mars production '
                'requires enormous quantities of methane and oxygen to refuel '
                'Starships flying back to Earth, as well as the local '
                'production of materials which are scarce on Mars but common '
                'on Earth, such as nitrogen. These are shown in the modified '
                'graph below.',
                'This graph shows all the same commodities with Mars '
                'consumption and production cost modified by several educated '
                'guesses. A city attempting industrial closure with a small '
                'number of people must have extremely high ',
                ' productivity, at least by Earth standards. This implies a '
                'higher ',
                'production cost and consumption. In addition, basic raw '
                'materials are also consumed at much higher rates and costs in '
                'order to fuel both industry and Starships.',
                'Despite these larger numbers, local production of raw '
                'materials still costs less than $100/kg, which is less than '
                'they could ever cost to import even if Starships were free. '
                'This suggests that even in a future where Starship is able to '
                'deliver cargo to the surface of Mars for 20x less than Falcon '
                'can deliver to LEO today, local production is still favored.',
                'Finally, let’s take a look at the same graph, but with costs '
                'determined by import, at a base rate of $200/kg. $200/kg is '
                'extremely ambitious but not physically impossible. ',
                'At $200/kg, the cost of nearly every import falls on the '
                'green diagonal, indicating that importation is the major cost '
                'driver. Indeed, very few commodities have higher unit prices '
                'than this. This is the main reason that ',

                'commodities for a growing Mars city.',
                'The first thing to notice is that the ',
                'costs for basic raw materials such as rubble, oxygen, '
                'methane, and water, are beyond ridiculous in an import '
                'scenario. For industrial scale water consumption without '
                'recycling, annual water imports alone are about $10b/',
                '. ',
                'In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) is absolutely mandatory '
                'from the very beginning for any material in the top right '
                'section of the graph, including nitrogen, concrete, oxygen, '
                'rubble, methane, and water. Fortunately, all of these '
                'materials are readily obtained almost anywhere on Mars, and '
                'many of them can be obtained via pipelines in non '
                'solid-phase. For crushed rocks, it is not necessary to find '
                'an ore body as the whole planet is made of rocks. '
                'Importantly, none of these materials will require incredibly '
                'sophisticated remotely operated robotic mining and refining '
                'equipment with science fiction capabilities.',
                'Mars’ atmosphere provides limitless quantities of nitrogen '
                'and CO2, requiring only an intake, compressor, dust filter, '
                'and cryogenic distillation for separation. A subsurface water '
                'well (either into ice or an aquifer) provides water and, in '
                'turn all the hydrogen needed to synthesize methane (',
                '). Rubble can be processed from generic local regolith, and '
                'will be used in large volumes for thermal and radiation '
                'shielding, road building, cement, and masonry. This is '
                'notable distinct from, eg, titanium, which will require the '
                'discovery of concentrated ore somewhere, plus the creation of '
                'a local mining town to extract and refine the product before '
                'trucking it back to the city. ',
                'Finally, processing all these materials requires the local '
                'generation of electricity, either with large photovoltaic '
                'solar farms, or nuclear power plants. The power requirement '
                'will be around 10 kW/',
                'Because solar farms are essentially two dimensional, panels '
                'can be made extremely thin and light, with a ',
                'panel mass allocation of less than 100 kg. ',
                'Establishing a local supply chain for these generically '
                'available raw materials lowers the cost of marginal '
                'immigration to the point where it’s conceivably possible to '
                'operate a large outpost, similar in scope to ',
                '. Without further local production, annual ',
                'material imports would be around 10 T at a cost of $2m. ',
                'Cutting this mass requirement back by a few orders of '
                'magnitude would enable human immigrants to Mars to rise, as a '
                'fraction of the total mass flux, from about 0.1% to 20% or '
                'more, an increase of a factor of 200. If the McMurdo analog '
                'city housed 1200 people with ',
                ' turnover of 400 every 26 months, roughly 180 Starships would '
                'be needed for resupply and perhaps just two or three for '
                'passenger transport. With the same 7 year tours of duty, the '
                'same sized Starship fleet could support a base with a '
                'population of over 100,000, if Mars-manufacture of basic '
                'commodities permitted the fleet to mostly carry people and '
                'their personal supplies. For reference, a fleet of 185 '
                'Starships would require roughly 500 launches per year for LEO '
                'refilling, and would cost about $7b/year to operate given '
                'launch costs of $10m and single trip cargo Starships costing '
                '$10m to produce. Under this paradigm, growing Starship '
                'production capacity could support a city of a million people '
                'for less than $70b/year, and that’s assuming everyone still '
                'comes home after a 7 year term of duty. If most migrants are '
                'traveling one way, net transport of 150,000 people to Mars '
                'every 26 months would require the production and launch of '
                '400 Starships every launch window, at a total program cost of '
                'just $28b.',
                'Even better, for commodities whose annual ',
                'consumption falls between roughly 10 kg and 10 T, moving '
                'production to Mars is enormously competitive and thus '
                'enormously profitable. While local production of eye-watering '
                'quantities of water, oxygen, methane, aggregate, and nitrogen '
                'is a basic necessity for any kind of viable Mars base, '
                'onshoring production of steel, food staples, plastics, '
                'fasteners, chemicals, glass, copper, and some textiles would '
                'drive the city’s economic engine of expansion. Completing '
                'this transition would lower ',
                'material imports from 10 T to perhaps 20 kg, reducing the '
                'cost of these commodities from $2m to around $100,000. The '
                'Mars city’s average GDP ',
                ' will be at least 10x the US average today, meaning around '
                '$650,000. Import costs, while still substantial and '
                'unbalanced, will be less than 15% of total economic activity.',
                'What about commodities with consumption below 10 kg/',
                '? For the most part, these are high specific cost items whose '
                'importation cost penalty is roughly the same as the Mars '
                'manufacturing difficulty penalty. That is, there is no strong '
                'economic reason to onshore production. There are '
                'non-economic, strategic reasons to onshore at least partial '
                'local production of 6502 processors or electric motors, but '
                'it’s unlikely to be wildly profitable without some kind of '
                'import tariff. ',
                'Indeed, a 4-9 month interplanetary voyage on Starship would '
                'require a few hundred kilograms of consumables per passenger, '
                'plus a personal luggage allocation of a similar size. So it '
                'is conceivable that each migrant could bring with them a ',
                ' of underwear, flash memory, and pharmaceuticals, without '
                'significantly affecting the per-passenger mass overhead. In '
                'other words, once ~80 kg people and their life support '
                'equipment become the dominant form of transported freight, '
                'extremely high value and low mass high tech and luxury items '
                'do not consume much marginal capacity. ',
                'While this analysis has been prepared using a Mars cargo '
                'transport cost of $200/kg, the results do not vary much even '
                'as this changes. Commodities split into three categories: raw '
                'material (local production mandatory), secondary commodities '
                '(local production profitable) and high tech/luxury goods '
                '(local production requires tariffs). The precise boundaries '
                'between these three categories do not even move much for a '
                'range of plausible shipping costs. Essentially anything that '
                'can be made from water, Mars atmosphere, or surface rocks '
                'must always be made locally. Anything simpler than textiles '
                'is profitable to produce on Mars. And anything requiring '
                'precision manufacturing is probably cheaper to import in '
                'bulk. ',
                'Let’s make this observation concrete. ',
                'Shipping costs can climb to $2000/kg, creating more of an '
                'economic driver to produce, eg, bearings and motors on Mars. '
                'Yet the ',
                'consumption is still around 10 kg/year, so the total local '
                'addressable market for local production is small while total '
                'importation costs are still quite low in the overall grand '
                'scheme. ',
                'Alternatively, shipping costs could fall to $10/kg. This '
                'would require several large miracles in Earth-based fuel '
                'costs and Starship production, and for what? Local oxygen '
                'production would become less compelling, but the city would '
                'still require 30 T/',
                'annually, which would swamp the entire cargo manifest. ',
                'Fundamentally, any Mars city construction is going to cost a '
                'lot of money, essentially determined by the rate of Starship '
                'launches. The goal of the mission planners is to maximize the '
                'return on investment given by those several thousand cargo '
                'transport missions. Given some finite cargo capacity to '
                'maximize the rate and number of economically productive '
                'migrants, it will always be necessary to do massive scale '
                'Mars-based fuel ISRU production, along with related basic '
                'products. Once this exists, return flights and a population '
                'of thousands is possible. Their task is to diversify the '
                'local supply chain and build out the middle tranche of basic '
                'industrial commodities. But no matter how cheap Starships '
                'get, localizing production of, eg, computer chips will '
                'consume scarce labor without necessarily improving the '
                'migration rate. ',
                'Ultimately, a self-sustaining Mars city must be able to '
                'produce everything it needs locally. During the scaling '

                'Even arts and entertainment businesses require constant '
                'infusions of fresh talent and new ways of thinking. It’s '
                'their lifeblood and oxygen. And if they can’t (or won’t) find '
                'it, stagnation sets in. At that juncture, even major artistic '
                'endeavors start to feel anachronistic and backward-looking. ',
                'Could this really be happening now, and in our culture? ',
                'It seems impossible—after all, billions of dollars are spent '
                'every year by entertainment corporations in their quest for '
                'market dominance. Yet, despite this constant spending spree, '
                'almost every week brings a new sign of cultural stagnation.',
                'But they have gotten worse.',
                'The latest report shows that the consumption of old music '
                'grew another 14% during the first half of 2022, while demand '
                'for new music declined an additional 1.4%. These old tunes '
                'now represent a staggering 72% of the market.',
                'If this were just a short term blip of nostalgia caused by a '
                'popular TV show, I might ignore these numbers. But every '
                'other bit of market research tells the same story.\xa0\xa0',
                'If you think things are bad now, just wait. The next wave of '
                'cinema tech will allow studios to make films with dead '
                'actors. That will get interesting—especially when the corpses '
                'are called to the podium to accept their Academy Awards. '
                'Well, at least nobody will get slapped onstage. ',
                'I’d like to be amused by all this, or maybe even applaud '
                'these senior citizens who have somehow extended their careers '
                'beyond normal limits. But the larger picture is disturbing.',
                'But when cultures stop innovating, they soon lose the '
                'essential skills they need for their survival. I’m reminded '
                'of the Arch of Constantine built by order of the Roman Senate '
                'between the years 312 and 315 AD—when the Empire, for all its '
                'military might, had forgotten how to create impressive '
                'artistic works.',
                'As a result, the builders of this monument had to steal parts '
                'from older structures. You could call it the first reboot, '
                'and it looks a lot like the entertainment business today. '
                'They took works designed to honor earlier emperors—Marcus '
                'Aurelius, Hadrian, Trajan—and pretended they were relevant to '
                'the current situation. The result was what we call '
                'anachronism—when something from a different time period is '
                'placed incoherently in the midst of newer material.',
                'It’s like walking down the street in a suit of armor, or '
                'riding a horse to the supermarket. It might seem amusing at '
                'first, but when you start seeing things like this everyday, '
                'you begin to get worried.',
                'We have now apparently arrived at the Era of Anachronism in '
                'our own creative culture. An 80-year-old man is the star of '
                'an action movie. A tune from a different century is the song '
                'of the summer. Superheroes from the distant days before World '
                'War II are constantly juxtaposed with current urban blight, '
                'as if it were the most natural thing in the world. And maybe '
                'all this is even entertaining for a while—until you start '
                'asking how this story ends.',
                'But we already know the answer to that. There have been other '
                'periods of artistic stagnation in the past, and they usually '
                'signaled a collapse in other spheres of society too. You '
                'can’t lose creativity in the arts—its natural home—without '
                'seeing a rise of close-mindedness in other fields as well.',

                'In 1986, the band "The Bangles" sang about "all the old '
                'paintings on the tombs" where the figures they depict are '
                '"walking like an Egyptian." Though he was neither an art '
                'historian nor an Egyptologist, songwriter Liam Sternberg was '
                'referring to one of the most striking features of ',
                ' visual art — the depiction of people, animals and objects on '
                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '
                'below.',
                '—',
                '—',
                '—',
                'Egyptian visual art used "more or less universal human '
                'approaches to representation on a flat surface," Baines '
                'said.\xa0',
                '"It [Egyptian art] influenced art in the ancient Near East," '
                'such as ancient Syrian (or Levantine) and ',
                ' art, Baines said. The same conventions can be seen in many '
                'other ancient traditions of art. ',
                ' art also uses pictorial scenes and hieroglyphic script. '
                'Although classical Greek and ',
                ' art is an exception, there are even examples of similar '
                'artistic conventions for two-dimensional drawing and painting '
                'from medieval Europe. As Baines explained, "It\'s a system '

                'The year is 2008 and I had been using Mozilla Firefox for two '
                'years after my painful but inevitable breakup with Internet '
                'Explorer. But, out of school and professional necessity, I '
                'had to make the switch to Google Chrome.',
                'For the most part, it worked out for me. It had features that '
                'Firefox at the time didn’t, like being able to sync and '
                'access tabs from other devices or saving all my bookmarks '
                'under a single profile that I could transfer to other '
                'PCs.\xa0',
                'Then over the years, Google became more invasive. It, like '
                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '
                'processing power is especially a problem for laptops or other '
                'devices with very little RAM.',
                'Which is why Mozilla Firefox is such a breath of fresh air, '
                'as it uses much less of your CPU while still delivering a '
                'fast browsing experience. So feel free to have as many tabs '
                'open as you want in Firefox, your device will barely feel the '

                'for improving IoT products over time, and applying security '
                'patches, but present a host of challenges. If the device '
                'performs safety-critical functions, like actuating power, '
                'medical equipment, or a connected car, the firmware and '
                'software cannot be updated without rigorous testing. If the '
                'device requires certification, updating it may require '
                'recertification. Updates are disruptive and need to be '
                'scheduled when the device is not performing its critical '
                'functions. Even just performing the update presents risks: if '
                'the update ends up bricking millions of devices and requires '
                'manual intervention, it could prove an existential risk to '
                'the business or the safety of individuals.',
                'As a result, edge firmware and software typically have long '
                'release cycles with significant hardware-in-the-loop testing. '
                'Firmware and software are usually bundled together and are '
                'only updated on the order of weeks or months. There is a '
                'natural reluctance to update any code at run-time given the '
                'potential for bugs and remote code execution (RCE) '
                'vulnerabilities. This makes iterating on product '
                'improvements, or quickly providing security patches, '
                'difficult.',
                'A firmware component that provides critical functions must '
                'always have a rigorous testing and release process. However, '
                'for a software component, it would provide a huge competitive '
                'advantage if it could be updated flexibly, even on-demand. '
                'Imagine the potential to iterate on a machine learning model '
                'daily, rather than every few months.',
                'This is why I find both the execution model and the security '
                'model of WebAssembly exciting. WebAssembly binaries can be '
                'very small, sometimes on the order of bytes, and they are '
                'portable across platforms. In terms of security, WebAssembly '
                'executes in a sandbox and the basic instruction set provides '
                'for nothing more than pure functions—numerical operations on '
                'its own memory. The WebAssembly code cannot read from, or '
                'write to, the file system, open ports, or access shared '
                'memory. The WebAssembly code can take advantage of functions '
                'or variables provided by the host, but only if the host '
                'provides these explicitly through imports. In other words, '
                'the host is in full control of what the WebAssembly code can '
                'do. The host can even limit the memory used or meter the '
                'number of instructions executed by the WebAssembly code. For '
                'building more complex applications that need to open ports or '
                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',
                'The adoption of WebAssembly in the cloud is limited, but it '
                'is more mature than the IoT edge. Both ',

                ', a messaging infrastructure compatible with the Kafka API, '
                'also adopted WebAssembly to run client code in event streams. '
                'For these vendors, WebAssembly is attractive because it is '
                'portable and sandboxed. Customers can write code in any '
                'language, as long as it compiles to WebAssembly, and because '
                'the vendor is running untrusted code, often in a multi-tenant '
                'environment, the strict sandboxing protects the vendor '
                'against malicious or buggy code, and helps provide tenant '
                'isolation. Cloudflare and Redpanda both use ',

                'In my work, I am not as concerned with running untrusted code '
                'because the software is vertically integrated from firmware '
                'all the way to cloud services. I am excited about WebAssembly '
                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '
                'developer for productivity, portability, and security.',
                'The ability to move computation from the cloud to the edge is '
                'revolutionary. Computation can be developed, tested, and '
                'benchmarked in the cloud using historical data stored in the '
                'cloud, simulated data, or live data streamed or queried from '
                'the IoT device. When you are satisfied with the results, the '
                'code can be moved from the cloud to the edge.',
                ' WebAssembly binaries are small, so they can be stored as '
                'configuration and synchronized to the IoT devices using '
                'existing mechanisms for desired-state configuration '
                'management. This makes it possible  to iterate on edge '
                'computation, reliably and securely, in hours or days, rather '
                'than weeks or months. Even experimental computation, for '
                'example, a new machine learning model, can run at the edge in '
                'shadow mode and report results back to the cloud for '
                'evaluation. In addition to this flexibility, moving '
                'computation to the edge can provide significant costs savings '
                'by taking advantage of existing edge computation, rather than '
                'consuming additional cloud resources.',
                'I have extensive experience with ',
                ', a toolkit for actor-model programming, distributed '
                'computing, and streaming data. Akka has been a wonderful '
                'platform for building reliable and scalable services for IoT. '
                'With Akka, the run-time is abstracted from the developer. The '
                'developer writes pure functions that are then composed into '
                'actors or streams. For actors, the run-time handles '
                'concurrency, distribution, location transparency, and '
                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '

                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '

                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '
                'model, but with even less boilerplate and richer primitives '
                'for handling messaging, dynamics, failure, and state. '
                'WebAssembly holds a lot of promise in being able to separate '

                'WebAssembly has small binaries that can be downloaded quickly '
                'and run efficiently without a lot of start-up overhead, it is '

                ' wasmCloud looks the most like what I am familiar with with '
                'Akka, where it is easy to model IoT devices with actors. One '
                'thing I would not want to lose with any of these models is '
                'type safety and there needs to be system-wide type checking '

                ', ',
                ', ',
                ', and others, all seem like viable options that can be used '
                'as a library from various programming languages. WebAssembly '
                'is portable across run-times, but changing from one host '
                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '
                'portable way, WASI, or another standard built on top of WASI, '
                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '
                'machine. Python, however, feels awkward. If my understanding '
                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '
                'from a language that is strongly typed, supports functional '
                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '
                'language for any new development.',
                'Finally, if your application must take advantage of multiple '
                'cores, support for multi-threading in library run-times is '
                'still new and limited. That said, for many applications, like '
                'numerical computation, WebAssembly is very fast and runs with '
                'native performance. The performance is also very predictable '
                'since there is no garbage collection. Most run-times also '
                'have support for Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) '
                'which use the processor more efficiently for repetitive '
                'calculations on large data sets. For the majority of the '
                'applications I am looking at, multi-threading should not be a '
                'major limitation, and WebAssembly should deliver excellent '
                'and efficient performance.',
                'WebAssembly is portable, can be targeted from multiple '
                'programming languages, has small binaries, runs efficiently, '
                'and has a very strict sandboxing model. This makes it '
                'exciting for IoT:',
                'Why am I excited about WebAssembly? I have not used '
                'WebAssembly in a product, so I am not speaking from direct '
                'experience, but I am excited about WebAssembly for IoT, for '
                'both the edge and the cloud, and for a more flexible '

                'coffees and meals significantly adds up across days, weeks, '
                'and months.',
                'I recently applied the same principle to my subscriptions. '
                'Over the past several years, as more and more apps have moved '
                'from standalone releases to yearly subscription pricing, the '
                'drip of yearly costs continues to accrue. What I find '

                'habituate to it, the monthly fees becoming just another '
                'expense in the litany of other costs that are part of '
                'adulting. They become invisible.',
                "So this isn't a repudiation of subscription models; more an "
                'experiment to 1) become more aware of what I was spending and '
                '2) assess whether I was happy with the value I was getting '
                'from these apps. Do you know how much you spend across all '
                'your monthly subscriptions?',
                'The first step was to go into Settings and calculate the '
                'subscriptions listed there, including many of my streaming, '

                'apps like Sketch, MLB, and NordVPN.\xa0',
                'I currently divide my subscriptions into three categories. '
                'The first are apps that, if I stopped paying for them, I '
                'would 1) lose access to (e.g. Disney+, Audm, etc.), or 2) '
                'would severely curtail their functionality (e.g. Day One, '
                'Grammarly). The second category is apps that I purchased '
                'outright and have a hybrid approach where they receive '
                'updates for a while (e.g. one year) after purchase. For these '
                'apps, receiving new updates and features requires purchasing '
                'another year of updates, but most existing features prior to '
                'that date remain fully functional. Apps like Agenda, Nova, & '
                'CleanShot X follow this model. And finally, the third '
                'category is subscription applications I purchased a lifetime '
                'license for. This tier is often 2-5x the cost of an annual '
                'subscription, but it gives me access to the app and all its '
                'features for as long as it is supported. Apps like Calm, '
                'Flighty, & Darkroom offer this option in addition to '

                'Approximately 32,000 individuals’ neuroimaging (MRI) results '

                'living alone or far from family members increased the chance '

                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '
                'exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few '
                'examples of factors that keep people from socializing and '
                'connecting with others.',
                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '
                'loneliness and health comes from studies examining mortality '

                'According to this data, having a strong social network '

                'of day and showing all sorts of information, such as the '
                'current time and rain forecasts using radar data fetched '
                'online. Pretty neat! But how do you get these strips to show '
                'more than just a solid color (i.e. visual effects or '
                'animations), and actually use them as ‘dashboards’ in a '
                'scalable and maintainable way? In this project, I start out '
                'with a simple and robust (but not very powerful) solution, '
                'and end up with a ',
                ' over-engineered, but very flexible solution to this problem '
                'involving a custom programming language and bytecode '
                'instruction set.',
                'The recommended approach for controlling LED strips like this '
                'is by using ',
                '. ESPHome is a service that allows you to compile custom '
                'firmware for ESP8266, which can control LED strips (among '
                'many other things!) and allows for easy integration with ',
                '. The main benefit of ESPHome is easy device management: '
                'remote updating and reconfiguration is fully automated. '
                'Swapping out a broken ESP8266 or board is as easy as '
                'downloading the right firmware image from ESPHome, flashing '
                'it over USB, and swapping the hardware. The ESPHome firmware '
                'allows color and brightness to be set (from e.g. Home '
                'Assistant) for all LEDs at the same time. One way to make an '
                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',

                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '
                'where the last nibble determines the number of bytes to pop '
                '(conveniently making ‘0x00’ a no-operation). Similary, ‘0x11’ '
                'means ‘push a single byte’ (the byte to be pushed is the next '
                'byte in the code stream), 0x32 means ‘push the next 8 bytes '
                'as two integers’, et cetera. There are also operators (0x8• '
                'are binary operators, e.g. 0x80 is ‘add’ and 0x81 is '
                '‘subtract’) and jump instructions. Finally there are special '
                'instructions that push the length of the LED strip to the '
                'stack (0xe0 = get_length) and to set a pixel (0xe3 = '
                'set_pixel). ',
                'As an example, consider a simple program that loops from '
                '(get_length) down to zero:',
                'Next, I wrote a simple parser in Rust that could read a '
                'simple ‘programming language’ and compile it to the byte code '
                'just defined. For example, the program above can be written '
                'as:',
                'The equivalent of the example script above in this language '
                'would be the following:',

                'the LED strip ‘image’ created by the program (by calls to '
                'set_pixel) to the LED strip. The above program would '
                'effectively set all LEDs to yellow (RGB 255, 255, 0). The '
                'byte code for this program is as follows:',
                '17 bytes! (note that this works for strips of any length too. '
                'Nice.).',
                'Executing this code on an ESP8266 is very simply done using a '
                'for loop that iterates over the instructions, a giant switch '
                'statement that determines which instruction it is (based on '
                'the first nibble). The stack is simply an array of 32-bit '
                'integers with a separate value pointing at the last inserted '
                'item. Finally, there is a buffer for the LED data to be '
                'written to (by set_pixel). Even with this naive approach it '
                'is possible to reach a fairly high number of frames per '
                'second (of course depending on the amount of instructions '
                'that need to run between each frame). Currently this part is '
                'written in C++ using the Arduino toolkit, so it should be '

                'plausible conclusion, there could actually be more factors at '
                'play.\n',
                'When copyright holders discuss online piracy, they often '
                'highlight the associated losses. However, not all pirated '
                'downloads equal a loss.',
                'While there is certainly a group of pirates who simply refuse '
                'to pay for content, there are also people who simply can’t '
                'afford it. ',
                'This is particularly true for software, which can be rather '
                'pricey. Interestingly, software piracy can also open up a '
                'door to escape from poverty. Mastering coding or editing '
                'skills, for example, allows people to start a business or '
                'join the workforce. ',

                'software, mastered their skills, and went on to become a '
                'professional. This raises the question: can software piracy '
                'mitigate poverty?',
                'A ',
                ' published in the Balkan Journal of Social Sciences tries to '
                'provide some insight into the matter. The researchers examine '
                'the effect of software piracy on poverty in developing and '
                'Latin American economies between 2003 and 2017. ',
                'The piracy rate is determined by the per capita usage of '
                'pirated software or the claimed losses. Poverty is measured '
                'through six indicators including the percentage of the '
                'population living below the poverty threshold. ',
                'The overall conclusions based on those data are quite clear. '
                'Higher piracy levels are linked to less poverty. This effect '
                'is consistent and statistically significant for all six '
                'poverty indicators. ',
                '“[T]here is a statistically significant reverse relationship '
                'between usage of pirated software and poverty in all six '
                'poverty models for both developing and Latin American '
                'countries samples,” the researchers write.',
                'This link between piracy and poverty remains intact when the '
                'model is controlled for other variables such as unemployment '
                'and health expenditure. This means that the hypothesis that '
                '“increases in usage of pirated software decrease poverty” '
                'seems likely. ',
                'As highlighted earlier, it would make sense to find such an '
                'effect. That said, the methodology section of the paper is '
                'rather short and there is no discussion section that '
                'elaborates on the findings. However, people should always be '
                'cautious to explain such links as causal effects. ',
                'If we frame the research question the other way around, the '
                'results could also make sense. In other words, does a '
                'decrease in poverty lead to more software piracy?',
                'It’s not hard to imagine that people living far below the '
                'poverty line aren’t particularly concerned with downloading '
                'copies of Photoshop. However, as poverty decreases, they '
                'might be able to buy a computer, which undoubtedly increases '
                'their likelihood of pirating anything at all. ',
                'So perhaps software piracy lowers poverty, while lower '
                'poverty also leads to more piracy. This flywheel effect may '

                'JIT can emit a single integer division instruction, just like '

                "All of JavaScript's bitwise operators inherited from C "
                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',
                ' after your arithmetic operations, and for unsigned you use ',
                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '
                'floating-point division of two integers less than 2',
                ' and then converting the result to an integer gives the exact '
                'same result as an integer division instruction in every case. '
                "But the full range of 64 bit integers isn't representable in "
                'double precision floating point, and JavaScript numbers '
                'always have to behave as if they are represented by double '
                "precision floating point values even when that isn't true. "
                "The JIT compiler can't just do 64-bit integer math under the "
                "covers and pretend that it's floating point, because it would "
                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',
                "OK, 64-bit doesn't work, how about 16-bit and 8-bit? Well, on "
                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "
                'so bad, because CPUs add 32-bit numbers just as fast as 8-bit '
                'numbers. Where smaller types ',
                ' matter is in memory usage. If you want an array of bytes, '
                'but you use a JavaScript array to store JavaScript numbers '
                'instead, it will use 8 times the memory (and 8 times the '
                'memory bandwidth, and 8 times the cache space) because every '
                'JavaScript number is 8 bytes. Thankfully JavaScript has a '
                'solution for this too: typed arrays. Typed arrays can hold '
                '8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values in both signed and unsigned '
                "varieties. As an added benefit, since typed arrays can't hold "
                "object references, the garbage collector doesn't need to scan "
                'their contents, which also helps performance.',
                "Bonus question: what about 32-bit floating point? It's faster "
                'than 64-bit floating point, and used a lot in 3D graphics. '
                'Can we use a similar trick to make the JavaScript JIT emit '
                "32-bit float math instructions? The answer is yes, there's a "

                ' consumption (horizontal axis) and annual ',
                ' cost (vertical axis). On the far right we have water, which '

                'more sophisticated products with higher unit costs and lower '
                'production volumes. ',
                'On Mars, manufacturing costs will be higher and consumption '
                'patterns quite different. In particular, Mars production '
                'requires enormous quantities of methane and oxygen to refuel '
                'Starships flying back to Earth, as well as the local '
                'production of materials which are scarce on Mars but common '
                'on Earth, such as nitrogen. These are shown in the modified '
                'graph below.',
                'This graph shows all the same commodities with Mars '
                'consumption and production cost modified by several educated '
                'guesses. A city attempting industrial closure with a small '
                'number of people must have extremely high ',
                ' productivity, at least by Earth standards. This implies a '
                'higher ',
                'production cost and consumption. In addition, basic raw '
                'materials are also consumed at much higher rates and costs in '
                'order to fuel both industry and Starships.',
                'Despite these larger numbers, local production of raw '
                'materials still costs less than $100/kg, which is less than '
                'they could ever cost to import even if Starships were free. '
                'This suggests that even in a future where Starship is able to '
                'deliver cargo to the surface of Mars for 20x less than Falcon '
                'can deliver to LEO today, local production is still favored.',
                'Finally, let’s take a look at the same graph, but with costs '
                'determined by import, at a base rate of $200/kg. $200/kg is '
                'extremely ambitious but not physically impossible. ',
                'At $200/kg, the cost of nearly every import falls on the '

                'methane, and water, are beyond ridiculous in an import '

                'an ore body as the whole planet is made of rocks. '
                'Importantly, none of these materials will require incredibly '
                'sophisticated remotely operated robotic mining and refining '
                'equipment with science fiction capabilities.',
                'Mars’ atmosphere provides limitless quantities of nitrogen '
                'and CO2, requiring only an intake, compressor, dust filter, '
                'and cryogenic distillation for separation. A subsurface water '
                'well (either into ice or an aquifer) provides water and, in '
                'turn all the hydrogen needed to synthesize methane (',
                '). Rubble can be processed from generic local regolith, and '
                'will be used in large volumes for thermal and radiation '
                'shielding, road building, cement, and masonry. This is '
                'notable distinct from, eg, titanium, which will require the '
                'discovery of concentrated ore somewhere, plus the creation of '
                'a local mining town to extract and refine the product before '
                'trucking it back to the city. ',
                'Finally, processing all these materials requires the local '
                'generation of electricity, either with large photovoltaic '
                'solar farms, or nuclear power plants. The power requirement '
                'will be around 10 kW/',
                'Because solar farms are essentially two dimensional, panels '
                'can be made extremely thin and light, with a ',

                'Establishing a local supply chain for these generically '
                'available raw materials lowers the cost of marginal '
                'immigration to the point where it’s conceivably possible to '
                'operate a large outpost, similar in scope to ',
                '. Without further local production, annual ',
                'material imports would be around 10 T at a cost of $2m. ',
                'Cutting this mass requirement back by a few orders of '
                'magnitude would enable human immigrants to Mars to rise, as a '
                'fraction of the total mass flux, from about 0.1% to 20% or '
                'more, an increase of a factor of 200. If the McMurdo analog '
                'city housed 1200 people with ',
                ' turnover of 400 every 26 months, roughly 180 Starships would '
                'be needed for resupply and perhaps just two or three for '
                'passenger transport. With the same 7 year tours of duty, the '
                'same sized Starship fleet could support a base with a '
                'population of over 100,000, if Mars-manufacture of basic '
                'commodities permitted the fleet to mostly carry people and '
                'their personal supplies. For reference, a fleet of 185 '

                'Essentially the whole Starship aside from the engines is '
                'going to be high value parts and materials that you could use '
                'on Mars, and even the raptors might be more valuable for '
                'their material content than as engines.',
                'I can’t see shipping Raptors back to Earth as being more '
                'interesting than using the Martian Raptors for voyages to '
                'Jupiter, or further out. Mars seems like the obvious '
                'refuelling point for outer system exploration. I have no idea '
                'whether it’d make sense to go to Venus or Mercury via Mars, '

                'I’ve been pessimistic about medium- to long-distance '
                'transport being worthwhile on Mars, because I suspect that '
                'abrasive dust will be a much greater source of wear-and-tear '
                'on machinery than it is on our warm, moist planet.  But I '
                'like the idea of pipelines.  If titanium is much easier to '
                'extract in one place than another, it might be worth setting '

                'Likewise for various other metals as cations, and for '
                'phosphate and sulfate.  I think most work will be done by '

                'will need to be within a reasonable light-speed lag but not '
                'directly on-site.  Of course, I may be wrong about many '
                'implicit assumptions, such as how easy it is to insulate a '
                'pipe well enough to keep water liquid for many kilometers.',
                'I’m still guessing that it will mostly be better to process '
                'ordinary rock into differentiated materials, rather than '
                'leaving it as crushed whole rock.  I’m fairly optimistic '
                'about how easy it is to get various metals from ordinary '
                'rock.  On Earth, we have lots of kinds of ore and we have '
                'rivers and oceans that give us virtually frictionless '
                'transport on infrastructure that just exists without us '
                'having to do anything.  So of course we mine ore, and we '
                'would even if processing of ordinary whole rock into multiple '
                'useful materials were orders of magnitude easier than even I '
                'am guessing it will be.  ',
                'I’m also optimistic about the price, mass, and versatility of '
                'machinery for precision manufacturing, compared to the cost '
                'of transport to Mars, compared to the cost of producing '
                'mid-tier bulk materials on Mars, and compared to the '
                'difficulty of anticipating exactly what the Martians will '
                'need and want for the time from one launch window to the '
                'next.  So I expect anything that can be precision-machined '

                '"walking like an Egyptian." Though he was neither an art '
                'historian nor an Egyptologist, songwriter Liam Sternberg was '
                'referring to one of the most striking features of ',
                ' visual art — the depiction of people, animals and objects on '
                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '

                '“It is a sign of the speed at which events are moving that '
                'Hurst and Blackett’s unexpurgated edition of\xa0',
                ', published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler '
                'angle. The obvious intention of the translator’s preface and '
                'notes is to tone down the book’s ferocity and present Hitler '
                'in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was '
                'still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, '
                'and for that the property-owning classes were willing to '
                'forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in '
                'the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a '
                'version of Conservatism.',
                'Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable '
                'after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett’s '
                'edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all '
                'profits would be devoted to the Red Cross. Nevertheless, '
                'simply on the internal evidence of\xa0',
                ', it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken '
                'place in Hitler’s aims and opinions. When one compares his '
                'utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years '
                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '
                'version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have '
                'enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their '
                'peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more '
                'grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ '
                'Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and '
                'death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his '
                'feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change '
                'their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years '
                'of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the '
                'greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better '
                'an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner. '
                'Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we '

                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '

                'batteries-included take on development that is very different '

                'I’m not sure whether it’s a blessing or a curse, but '

                'conception of a batteries-included standard library.',
                'The history is a little unclear to me, but it seems like '
                'Python (1991) was the first language to take the stance of '
                'really having an extensive standard library. Java 1.0 (1996) '
                'also came with an extensive standard library (The Java Class '

                'Most modern languages (that aren’t JavaScript) now ship with '
                'extensive standard libraries. In particular, though, Go puts '
                'special emphasis on its standard library. It promises '
                'backward compatibility, performance, and well-thought-out '
                'implementations. Because of this, Go developers lean on the '

                'it’s fair to say that people who used and contributed to CPAN '
                'knew it was a game-changer.',
                'CPAN was launched in 1995 (based on CTAN), and by its height '
                'in 2003, it had established a new way for people to get '

                'created after 2003 that didn’t come with a third-party '
                'package repository of some sort. CPAN moved the line so that '
                'from then forward, a “real” programming language needed to '
                'have a strategy for third-party package management.',
                'Ok, so you might wonder, if CPAN made Perl better and every '
                'language moving forward embraced package managers for '
                'third-party code, why didn’t languages predating this add on '
                'package managers after the fact?',
                'Well, they did, but it doesn’t seem obvious how to get '
                'agreement in a language community after a certain point. I’m '
                'not sure why this is, but maybe people don’t like change?',
                'This is going to be a running theme. Once the idioms and '
                'patterns of a programming language, and a language community, '
                'have been established its hard to go back and add things on. '
                'At least I think this is why Javascript has NPM, Rust has '
                'crates but C++ has ',
                '. You know what is better than one universally agreed upon '
                'package manager? Not eight of them!',
                'One counter point on backporting here though is standard '
                'libraries. C++ added its standard library rather late in the '
                'game, by successfully bringing parts of STL under its roof. '
                'So existing languages can adopt tooling innovations, its just '
                'a bigger lift.',
                'So after CPAN, a great standard library that does most of the '
                'things you need to do, augmented with a third-party package '
                'repository that is simple to use and straight forward to '

                'academic study adds an interesting angle by suggesting that '
                'software piracy might lower poverty. While this is a '
                'plausible conclusion, there could actually be more factors at '
                'play.\n',
                'When copyright holders discuss online piracy, they often '
                'highlight the associated losses. However, not all pirated '
                'downloads equal a loss.',
                'While there is certainly a group of pirates who simply refuse '
                'to pay for content, there are also people who simply can’t '
                'afford it. ',
                'This is particularly true for software, which can be rather '
                'pricey. Interestingly, software piracy can also open up a '
                'door to escape from poverty. Mastering coding or editing '
                'skills, for example, allows people to start a business or '
                'join the workforce. ',

                ' of top designers who started with a piece of pirated '
                'software, mastered their skills, and went on to become a '
                'professional. This raises the question: can software piracy '
                'mitigate poverty?',

                ' published in the Balkan Journal of Social Sciences tries to '
                'provide some insight into the matter. The researchers examine '
                'the effect of software piracy on poverty in developing and '
                'Latin American economies between 2003 and 2017. ',
                'The piracy rate is determined by the per capita usage of '
                'pirated software or the claimed losses. Poverty is measured '
                'through six indicators including the percentage of the '
                'population living below the poverty threshold. ',
                'The overall conclusions based on those data are quite clear. '
                'Higher piracy levels are linked to less poverty. This effect '
                'is consistent and statistically significant for all six '
                'poverty indicators. ',
                '“[T]here is a statistically significant reverse relationship '
                'between usage of pirated software and poverty in all six '
                'poverty models for both developing and Latin American '
                'countries samples,” the researchers write.',
                'This link between piracy and poverty remains intact when the '
                'model is controlled for other variables such as unemployment '
                'and health expenditure. This means that the hypothesis that '
                '“increases in usage of pirated software decrease poverty” '
                'seems likely. ',

                'effect. That said, the methodology section of the paper is '
                'rather short and there is no discussion section that '
                'elaborates on the findings. However, people should always be '
                'cautious to explain such links as causal effects. ',
                'If we frame the research question the other way around, the '
                'results could also make sense. In other words, does a '
                'decrease in poverty lead to more software piracy?',
                'It’s not hard to imagine that people living far below the '

                'securely and efficiently run code at both the edge and in the '
                'cloud to support the Internet of Things (IoT).',

                'thermostats, solar inverters, factory equipment, medical '
                'devices, or connected cars.',

                'and span everything from:',
                'Over-the-air updates for firmware and software are critical '
                'for improving IoT products over time, and applying security '
                'patches, but present a host of challenges. If the device '
                'performs safety-critical functions, like actuating power, '
                'medical equipment, or a connected car, the firmware and '
                'software cannot be updated without rigorous testing. If the '
                'device requires certification, updating it may require '
                'recertification. Updates are disruptive and need to be '
                'scheduled when the device is not performing its critical '
                'functions. Even just performing the update presents risks: if '
                'the update ends up bricking millions of devices and requires '
                'manual intervention, it could prove an existential risk to '
                'the business or the safety of individuals.',
                'As a result, edge firmware and software typically have long '
                'release cycles with significant hardware-in-the-loop testing. '
                'Firmware and software are usually bundled together and are '
                'only updated on the order of weeks or months. There is a '
                'natural reluctance to update any code at run-time given the '
                'potential for bugs and remote code execution (RCE) '
                'vulnerabilities. This makes iterating on product '
                'improvements, or quickly providing security patches, '
                'difficult.',
                'A firmware component that provides critical functions must '
                'always have a rigorous testing and release process. However, '
                'for a software component, it would provide a huge competitive '
                'advantage if it could be updated flexibly, even on-demand. '
                'Imagine the potential to iterate on a machine learning model '
                'daily, rather than every few months.',
                'This is why I find both the execution model and the security '
                'model of WebAssembly exciting. WebAssembly binaries can be '
                'very small, sometimes on the order of bytes, and they are '
                'portable across platforms. In terms of security, WebAssembly '
                'executes in a sandbox and the basic instruction set provides '
                'for nothing more than pure functions—numerical operations on '
                'its own memory. The WebAssembly code cannot read from, or '
                'write to, the file system, open ports, or access shared '
                'memory. The WebAssembly code can take advantage of functions '
                'or variables provided by the host, but only if the host '
                'provides these explicitly through imports. In other words, '
                'the host is in full control of what the WebAssembly code can '
                'do. The host can even limit the memory used or meter the '
                'number of instructions executed by the WebAssembly code. For '
                'building more complex applications that need to open ports or '
                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',
                'The adoption of WebAssembly in the cloud is limited, but it '
                'is more mature than the IoT edge. Both ',

                ', a messaging infrastructure compatible with the Kafka API, '
                'also adopted WebAssembly to run client code in event streams. '
                'For these vendors, WebAssembly is attractive because it is '
                'portable and sandboxed. Customers can write code in any '
                'language, as long as it compiles to WebAssembly, and because '
                'the vendor is running untrusted code, often in a multi-tenant '
                'environment, the strict sandboxing protects the vendor '
                'against malicious or buggy code, and helps provide tenant '

                'all the way to cloud services. I am excited about WebAssembly '
                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '

                'With Akka, the run-time is abstracted from the developer. The '
                'developer writes pure functions that are then composed into '
                'actors or streams. For actors, the run-time handles '
                'concurrency, distribution, location transparency, and '
                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '
                'binary, when all the developer is really concerned about is '
                'writing the business logic associated with each route. As a '
                'result, developers end up maintaining a lot of boilerplate '
                'and framework code.',
                'To demonstrate the challenge, consider hundreds of services '
                'using an HTTP server compiled into the application binary. '
                'There are likely many different versions depending on when '
                'the application was last compiled and deployed. If there is a '
                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '
                'logic? This would be similar to how host operating systems '
                'can be patched underneath Kubernetes and no one needs to '
                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '
                'model, but with even less boilerplate and richer primitives '
                'for handling messaging, dynamics, failure, and state. '
                'WebAssembly holds a lot of promise in being able to separate '
                'the run-time environment from the business logic and there '
                'are a few platforms evolving in this direction.',
                ' is a means of running WebAssembly on Kubernetes. Because '
                'WebAssembly has small binaries that can be downloaded quickly '
                'and run efficiently without a lot of start-up overhead, it is '
                'attractive for serverless functions.',

                ' wasmCloud looks the most like what I am familiar with with '
                'Akka, where it is easy to model IoT devices with actors. One '
                'thing I would not want to lose with any of these models is '
                'type safety and there needs to be system-wide type checking '
                'that can be performed statically, not just at run-time.',

                ', ',
                ', ',
                ', and others, all seem like viable options that can be used '
                'as a library from various programming languages. WebAssembly '
                'is portable across run-times, but changing from one host '
                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '
                'portable way, WASI, or another standard built on top of WASI, '
                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '
                'machine. Python, however, feels awkward. If my understanding '
                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '
                'from a language that is strongly typed, supports functional '
                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '
                'language for any new development.',
                'Finally, if your application must take advantage of multiple '
                'cores, support for multi-threading in library run-times is '
                'still new and limited. That said, for many applications, like '
                'numerical computation, WebAssembly is very fast and runs with '
                'native performance. The performance is also very predictable '
                'since there is no garbage collection. Most run-times also '
                'have support for Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) '
                'which use the processor more efficiently for repetitive '
                'calculations on large data sets. For the majority of the '
                'applications I am looking at, multi-threading should not be a '
                'major limitation, and WebAssembly should deliver excellent '
                'and efficient performance.',
                'WebAssembly is portable, can be targeted from multiple '
                'programming languages, has small binaries, runs efficiently, '
                'and has a very strict sandboxing model. This makes it '

                'controlled individually, which makes them really versatile '
                'for use in e.g. home automation. Throughout my home there are '
                'several strips, each adapting their hue to the current time '
                'of day and showing all sorts of information, such as the '
                'current time and rain forecasts using radar data fetched '
                'online. Pretty neat! But how do you get these strips to show '
                'more than just a solid color (i.e. visual effects or '
                'animations), and actually use them as ‘dashboards’ in a '
                'scalable and maintainable way? In this project, I start out '
                'with a simple and robust (but not very powerful) solution, '
                'and end up with a ',
                ' over-engineered, but very flexible solution to this problem '
                'involving a custom programming language and bytecode '
                'instruction set.',
                'The recommended approach for controlling LED strips like this '
                'is by using ',
                '. ESPHome is a service that allows you to compile custom '
                'firmware for ESP8266, which can control LED strips (among '
                'many other things!) and allows for easy integration with ',
                '. The main benefit of ESPHome is easy device management: '
                'remote updating and reconfiguration is fully automated. '
                'Swapping out a broken ESP8266 or board is as easy as '
                'downloading the right firmware image from ESPHome, flashing '
                'it over USB, and swapping the hardware. The ESPHome firmware '
                'allows color and brightness to be set (from e.g. Home '
                'Assistant) for all LEDs at the same time. One way to make an '
                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',
                'Ideally, we would like to send short ‘animations’ or videos '
                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '

                'But sadly, there are lots of lonely or socially isolated '
                'people. And if the human brain did indeed develop for social '
                'interaction, then we should anticipate this to have a '
                'substantial impact.',
                'A recent study published in Neurology indicates that social '
                'isolation increases the risk of dementia in older people and '
                'is as well associated with changes in brain structure and '
                'cognition, which is the mental process of learning.',
                'The social brain hypothesis, which hypothesizes that the '

                'demonstrated a strong relationship between brain regions '
                'consistently involved in various social interactions and '
                'networks that underpin cognition.',
                'This also includes the default mode network – active when we '

                'network, the subcortical network, which is involved in '
                'memory, emotion and motivation as well as the central '
                'executive network, which enables us to regulate our emotions.',
                'The goal of this research is to learn more about the impact '
                'of social isolation on grey matter, which is made up of '
                'neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from '
                'the UK Biobank which contains information on nearly 500,000 '
                'individuals with an average age of 57 was used.',
                'Socially isolated as defined in this case is\xa0 a person who '
                'lived alone, interacted with other people less frequently '
                'than once a month and engaged in social activities less '
                'frequently than once a week.',
                'Approximately 32,000 individuals’ neuroimaging (MRI) results '
                'were also included in the study. This demonstrated that those '
                'who are socially isolated have lower levels of cognition, '
                'including memory and reaction time as well as less grey '
                'matter in several areas of the brain.',
                'These regions included the hippocampus, which is a crucial '
                'area involved in learning and memory that is typically '
                'disrupted early in Alzheimer’s illness, the temporal region, '

                'person may have chronic stress. This has a significant effect '
                'on both his or her physical and mental wellbeing.',
                'Another aspect might be that an individual\xa0loses some of '

                'Also, due to the fact that memory and attention are essential '

                'A national poll on loneliness conducted in 2019 found that '
                'living alone or far from family members increased the chance '
                'of loneliness. People who are unsatisfied with their social '
                'and family\xa0lives are also more likely to say they are '
                'lonely than people who are not.',
                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '
                'exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few '
                'examples of factors that keep people from socializing and '
                'connecting with others.',
                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '
                'loneliness and health comes from studies examining mortality '
                'as an outcome. A considerable body of evidence has '
                'accumulated over the last four decades, consisting of ',
                ' and hundreds of large-scale prospective epidemiological '
                'investigations.',
                'According to this data, having a strong social network '
                'greatly lowers the probability of dying young from any cause. '
                'By way of illustration, a meta-analysis of 148 prospective '
                'studies discovered that social connection (averaged across a '

                'and months.',
                'I recently applied the same principle to my subscriptions. '
                'Over the past several years, as more and more apps have moved '

                'expense in the litany of other costs that are part of '

                "So this isn't a repudiation of subscription models; more an "
                'experiment to 1) become more aware of what I was spending and '
                '2) assess whether I was happy with the value I was getting '

                'apps like Sketch, MLB, and NordVPN.\xa0',
                'I currently divide my subscriptions into three categories. '
                'The first are apps that, if I stopped paying for them, I '
                'would 1) lose access to (e.g. Disney+, Audm, etc.), or 2) '
                'would severely curtail their functionality (e.g. Day One, '
                'Grammarly). The second category is apps that I purchased '
                'outright and have a hybrid approach where they receive '
                'updates for a while (e.g. one year) after purchase. For these '

                'another year of updates, but most existing features prior to '
                'that date remain fully functional. Apps like Agenda, Nova, & '
                'CleanShot X follow this model. And finally, the third '
                'category is subscription applications I purchased a lifetime '
                'license for. This tier is often 2-5x the cost of an annual '

                '“It is a sign of the speed at which events are moving that '
                'Hurst and Blackett’s unexpurgated edition of\xa0',
                ', published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler '
                'angle. The obvious intention of the translator’s preface and '
                'notes is to tone down the book’s ferocity and present Hitler '
                'in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was '
                'still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, '
                'and for that the property-owning classes were willing to '
                'forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in '
                'the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a '
                'version of Conservatism.',
                'Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable '
                'after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett’s '
                'edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all '
                'profits would be devoted to the Red Cross. Nevertheless, '
                'simply on the internal evidence of\xa0',
                ', it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken '
                'place in Hitler’s aims and opinions. When one compares his '
                'utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years '
                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '
                'version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have '
                'enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their '
                'peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more '
                'grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ '
                'Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and '
                'death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his '
                'feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change '
                'their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years '
                'of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the '
                'greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better '
                'an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner. '
                'Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we '
                'ought not to underrate its emotional appeal.”',

                'In 1986, the band "The Bangles" sang about "all the old '
                'paintings on the tombs" where the figures they depict are '
                '"walking like an Egyptian." Though he was neither an art '
                'historian nor an Egyptologist, songwriter Liam Sternberg was '
                'referring to one of the most striking features of ',
                ' visual art — the depiction of people, animals and objects on '
                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '
                'below.',
                '—',
                '—',
                '—',
                'Egyptian visual art used "more or less universal human '
                'approaches to representation on a flat surface," Baines '
                'said.\xa0',
                '"It [Egyptian art] influenced art in the ancient Near East," '
                'such as ancient Syrian (or Levantine) and ',
                ' art, Baines said. The same conventions can be seen in many '
                'other ancient traditions of art. ',
                ' art also uses pictorial scenes and hieroglyphic script. '
                'Although classical Greek and ',
                ' art is an exception, there are even examples of similar '

                'from medieval Europe. As Baines explained, "It\'s a system '

                'then convert it back to a double precision value. Weird!',

                ' will always be a floating point division with a floating '

                "more work. Of course you don't want your bitwise operator to "

                'such as ',
                ' or ',

                'all that slow conversion to and from floating point. It turns '
                'out that if you add a ',
                ' after every operation, your JavaScript JIT compiler can skip '
                'the redundant conversions too, and just keep your numbers as '
                'integers the whole time. When the inputs to a division are '

                ' converts it to integer again afterward, then instead of '
                'emitting two conversions to floating point, a floating point '
                'division instruction, and then a conversion to integer, the '
                'JIT can emit a single integer division instruction, just like '
                'a C compiler would. This is pretty miraculous!',
                "All of JavaScript's bitwise operators inherited from C "
                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',
                ' after your arithmetic operations, and for unsigned you use ',
                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '
                'floating-point division of two integers less than 2',
                ' and then converting the result to an integer gives the exact '
                'same result as an integer division instruction in every case. '
                "But the full range of 64 bit integers isn't representable in "
                'double precision floating point, and JavaScript numbers '
                'always have to behave as if they are represented by double '
                "precision floating point values even when that isn't true. "
                "The JIT compiler can't just do 64-bit integer math under the "
                "covers and pretend that it's floating point, because it would "
                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',
                "OK, 64-bit doesn't work, how about 16-bit and 8-bit? Well, on "
                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "
                'so bad, because CPUs add 32-bit numbers just as fast as 8-bit '
                'numbers. Where smaller types ',
                ' matter is in memory usage. If you want an array of bytes, '
                'but you use a JavaScript array to store JavaScript numbers '
                'instead, it will use 8 times the memory (and 8 times the '
                'memory bandwidth, and 8 times the cache space) because every '
                'JavaScript number is 8 bytes. Thankfully JavaScript has a '
                'solution for this too: typed arrays. Typed arrays can hold '
                '8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values in both signed and unsigned '
                "varieties. As an added benefit, since typed arrays can't hold "
                "object references, the garbage collector doesn't need to scan "
                'their contents, which also helps performance.',
                "Bonus question: what about 32-bit floating point? It's faster "
                'than 64-bit floating point, and used a lot in 3D graphics. '
                'Can we use a similar trick to make the JavaScript JIT emit '
                "32-bit float math instructions? The answer is yes, there's a "
                'function ',
                " used for this purpose by asm.js. I've never tried using it "
                'myself.',
                'Asm.js uses these techniques to translate C code to '

                "native C compilers. But you don't have to use asm.js to "
                'benefit. Anytime you want good performance in JavaScript, you '

                '(3-D printed machinery) but for most applications it’s just '
                'prohibitively capital and labor intensive.',
                'Great update! Any idea how much is too much when it comes to '
                'human time spent detaching-packing-loading raptors to ship '
                'back to Earth? Seems like a good way to think about labour '
                'cost and working conditions on each planet.',
                'It is hard to imagine that if there was a shortage of Raptors '
                'at the end of the production line in a factory on Earth that '

                'some used ones from Mars.',
                'It’s less that I think it makes sense to ship the Raptors '
                'back, as it’s about the only thing besides scientific samples '
                'and the rare return passenger that might make sense to send '
                'back.',
                'Essentially the whole Starship aside from the engines is '
                'going to be high value parts and materials that you could use '
                'on Mars, and even the raptors might be more valuable for '
                'their material content than as engines.',
                'I can’t see shipping Raptors back to Earth as being more '
                'interesting than using the Martian Raptors for voyages to '
                'Jupiter, or further out. Mars seems like the obvious '
                'refuelling point for outer system exploration. I have no idea '
                'whether it’d make sense to go to Venus or Mercury via Mars, '
                'but Jupiter, Saturn and further out seem like they’d benefit '
                'from essentially starting with a Starship full of fuel in '
                'Martian orbit.',
                'Both fair points. I was thinking of it as a thought '
                'experiment. Now it seems likly a calculation would more '
                'reflect the assumptions in the estimates than inform about '
                'the value of a human minute on Mars.',
                'I’ve been pessimistic about medium- to long-distance '
                'transport being worthwhile on Mars, because I suspect that '
                'abrasive dust will be a much greater source of wear-and-tear '
                'on machinery than it is on our warm, moist planet.  But I '
                'like the idea of pipelines.  If titanium is much easier to '
                'extract in one place than another, it might be worth setting '
                'up an outpost and piping titanium chloride in liquid water.  '
                'Likewise for various other metals as cations, and for '
                'phosphate and sulfate.  I think most work will be done by '
                'remotely-operated semi-autonomous machinery, so that humans '
                'will need to be within a reasonable light-speed lag but not '
                'directly on-site.  Of course, I may be wrong about many '
                'implicit assumptions, such as how easy it is to insulate a '
                'pipe well enough to keep water liquid for many kilometers.',
                'I’m still guessing that it will mostly be better to process '
                'ordinary rock into differentiated materials, rather than '
                'leaving it as crushed whole rock.  I’m fairly optimistic '
                'about how easy it is to get various metals from ordinary '
                'rock.  On Earth, we have lots of kinds of ore and we have '
                'rivers and oceans that give us virtually frictionless '
                'transport on infrastructure that just exists without us '
                'having to do anything.  So of course we mine ore, and we '
                'would even if processing of ordinary whole rock into multiple '
                'useful materials were orders of magnitude easier than even I '
                'am guessing it will be.  ',
                'I’m also optimistic about the price, mass, and versatility of '
                'machinery for precision manufacturing, compared to the cost '
                'of transport to Mars, compared to the cost of producing '
                'mid-tier bulk materials on Mars, and compared to the '
                'difficulty of anticipating exactly what the Martians will '
                'need and want for the time from one launch window to the '
                'next.  So I expect anything that can be precision-machined '
                'from basic materials to be made on Mars almost from the very '
                'beginning.  Engineering and design, after all, are '

                'essentially zero cost.',

                'The year is 2008 and I had been using Mozilla Firefox for two '
                'years after my painful but inevitable breakup with Internet '
                'Explorer. But, out of school and professional necessity, I '
                'had to make the switch to Google Chrome.',
                'For the most part, it worked out for me. It had features that '
                'Firefox at the time didn’t, like being able to sync and '
                'access tabs from other devices or saving all my bookmarks '
                'under a single profile that I could transfer to other '
                'PCs.\xa0',
                'Then over the years, Google became more invasive. It, like '
                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '
                'processing power is especially a problem for laptops or other '
                'devices with very little RAM.',
                'Which is why Mozilla Firefox is such a breath of fresh air, '
                'as it uses much less of your CPU while still delivering a '
                'fast browsing experience. So feel free to have as many tabs '
                'open as you want in Firefox, your device will barely feel the '

                'for nothing more than pure functions—numerical operations on '
                'its own memory. The WebAssembly code cannot read from, or '
                'write to, the file system, open ports, or access shared '
                'memory. The WebAssembly code can take advantage of functions '
                'or variables provided by the host, but only if the host '
                'provides these explicitly through imports. In other words, '
                'the host is in full control of what the WebAssembly code can '
                'do. The host can even limit the memory used or meter the '
                'number of instructions executed by the WebAssembly code. For '
                'building more complex applications that need to open ports or '
                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',
                'The adoption of WebAssembly in the cloud is limited, but it '

                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '
                'developer for productivity, portability, and security.',
                'The ability to move computation from the cloud to the edge is '
                'revolutionary. Computation can be developed, tested, and '
                'benchmarked in the cloud using historical data stored in the '
                'cloud, simulated data, or live data streamed or queried from '
                'the IoT device. When you are satisfied with the results, the '
                'code can be moved from the cloud to the edge.',
                ' WebAssembly binaries are small, so they can be stored as '
                'configuration and synchronized to the IoT devices using '
                'existing mechanisms for desired-state configuration '
                'management. This makes it possible  to iterate on edge '
                'computation, reliably and securely, in hours or days, rather '
                'than weeks or months. Even experimental computation, for '
                'example, a new machine learning model, can run at the edge in '
                'shadow mode and report results back to the cloud for '
                'evaluation. In addition to this flexibility, moving '
                'computation to the edge can provide significant costs savings '
                'by taking advantage of existing edge computation, rather than '
                'consuming additional cloud resources.',
                'I have extensive experience with ',
                ', a toolkit for actor-model programming, distributed '
                'computing, and streaming data. Akka has been a wonderful '
                'platform for building reliable and scalable services for IoT. '
                'With Akka, the run-time is abstracted from the developer. The '
                'developer writes pure functions that are then composed into '
                'actors or streams. For actors, the run-time handles '
                'concurrency, distribution, location transparency, and '
                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '
                'binary, when all the developer is really concerned about is '
                'writing the business logic associated with each route. As a '
                'result, developers end up maintaining a lot of boilerplate '
                'and framework code.',
                'To demonstrate the challenge, consider hundreds of services '
                'using an HTTP server compiled into the application binary. '
                'There are likely many different versions depending on when '
                'the application was last compiled and deployed. If there is a '
                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '
                'logic? This would be similar to how host operating systems '
                'can be patched underneath Kubernetes and no one needs to '
                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '

                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '
                'portable way, WASI, or another standard built on top of WASI, '
                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '
                'machine. Python, however, feels awkward. If my understanding '
                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '
                'from a language that is strongly typed, supports functional '
                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '
                'language for any new development.',
                'Finally, if your application must take advantage of multiple '

                'meals; it came to over $2,500. Both were very conservative '

                'coffees and meals significantly adds up across days, weeks, '
                'and months.',
                'I recently applied the same principle to my subscriptions. '
                'Over the past several years, as more and more apps have moved '
                'from standalone releases to yearly subscription pricing, the '
                'drip of yearly costs continues to accrue. What I find '
                'difficult about subscription pricing is that I very quickly '
                'habituate to it, the monthly fees becoming just another '
                'expense in the litany of other costs that are part of '
                'adulting. They become invisible.',
                "So this isn't a repudiation of subscription models; more an "
                'experiment to 1) become more aware of what I was spending and '
                '2) assess whether I was happy with the value I was getting '
                'from these apps. Do you know how much you spend across all '
                'your monthly subscriptions?',
                'The first step was to go into Settings and calculate the '
                'subscriptions listed there, including many of my streaming, '
                'note-taking, and productivity apps. Then I tracked down '
                'subscriptions I bought outside the App Store, including for '
                'apps like Sketch, MLB, and NordVPN.\xa0',
                'I currently divide my subscriptions into three categories. '
                'The first are apps that, if I stopped paying for them, I '
                'would 1) lose access to (e.g. Disney+, Audm, etc.), or 2) '
                'would severely curtail their functionality (e.g. Day One, '
                'Grammarly). The second category is apps that I purchased '
                'outright and have a hybrid approach where they receive '
                'updates for a while (e.g. one year) after purchase. For these '
                'apps, receiving new updates and features requires purchasing '
                'another year of updates, but most existing features prior to '
                'that date remain fully functional. Apps like Agenda, Nova, & '
                'CleanShot X follow this model. And finally, the third '
                'category is subscription applications I purchased a lifetime '
                'license for. This tier is often 2-5x the cost of an annual '
                'subscription, but it gives me access to the app and all its '
                'features for as long as it is supported. Apps like Calm, '

 'paragraphs': ['Digital RGB LED strips are strips of LED lights that can be '
                'controlled individually, which makes them really versatile '
                'for use in e.g. home automation. Throughout my home there are '
                'several strips, each adapting their hue to the current time '
                'of day and showing all sorts of information, such as the '
                'current time and rain forecasts using radar data fetched '
                'online. Pretty neat! But how do you get these strips to show '
                'more than just a solid color (i.e. visual effects or '
                'animations), and actually use them as ‘dashboards’ in a '
                'scalable and maintainable way? In this project, I start out '
                'with a simple and robust (but not very powerful) solution, '
                'and end up with a ',
                ' over-engineered, but very flexible solution to this problem '
                'involving a custom programming language and bytecode '
                'instruction set.',
                'The recommended approach for controlling LED strips like this '
                'is by using ',
                '. ESPHome is a service that allows you to compile custom '
                'firmware for ESP8266, which can control LED strips (among '
                'many other things!) and allows for easy integration with ',
                '. The main benefit of ESPHome is easy device management: '
                'remote updating and reconfiguration is fully automated. '
                'Swapping out a broken ESP8266 or board is as easy as '
                'downloading the right firmware image from ESPHome, flashing '
                'it over USB, and swapping the hardware. The ESPHome firmware '
                'allows color and brightness to be set (from e.g. Home '
                'Assistant) for all LEDs at the same time. One way to make an '
                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',
                'Ideally, we would like to send short ‘animations’ or videos '
                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '
                'where the last nibble determines the number of bytes to pop '
                '(conveniently making ‘0x00’ a no-operation). Similary, ‘0x11’ '
                'means ‘push a single byte’ (the byte to be pushed is the next '
                'byte in the code stream), 0x32 means ‘push the next 8 bytes '
                'as two integers’, et cetera. There are also operators (0x8• '
                'are binary operators, e.g. 0x80 is ‘add’ and 0x81 is '
                '‘subtract’) and jump instructions. Finally there are special '
                'instructions that push the length of the LED strip to the '
                'stack (0xe0 = get_length) and to set a pixel (0xe3 = '
                'set_pixel). ',
                'As an example, consider a simple program that loops from '
                '(get_length) down to zero:',
                'Next, I wrote a simple parser in Rust that could read a '
                'simple ‘programming language’ and compile it to the byte code '
                'just defined. For example, the program above can be written '
                'as:',
                'The equivalent of the example script above in this language '
                'would be the following:',
                'In the above, the ‘blit’ keyword tells the controller to send '
                'the LED strip ‘image’ created by the program (by calls to '
                'set_pixel) to the LED strip. The above program would '
                'effectively set all LEDs to yellow (RGB 255, 255, 0). The '
                'byte code for this program is as follows:',
                '17 bytes! (note that this works for strips of any length too. '
                'Nice.).',
                'Executing this code on an ESP8266 is very simply done using a '
                'for loop that iterates over the instructions, a giant switch '
                'statement that determines which instruction it is (based on '
                'the first nibble). The stack is simply an array of 32-bit '
                'integers with a separate value pointing at the last inserted '
                'item. Finally, there is a buffer for the LED data to be '
                'written to (by set_pixel). Even with this naive approach it '
                'is possible to reach a fairly high number of frames per '
                'second (of course depending on the amount of instructions '
                'that need to run between each frame). Currently this part is '
                'written in C++ using the Arduino toolkit, so it should be '
                'fairly easy to integrate it with ESPHome at some point.',

                'neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from '

                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '
                'exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few '
                'examples of factors that keep people from socializing and '

                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '
                'loneliness and health comes from studies examining mortality '

                'Piracy is a controversial topic and research into the effects '
                'of copyright infringement is widely debated as well. A new '
                'academic study adds an interesting angle by suggesting that '
                'software piracy might lower poverty. While this is a '
                'plausible conclusion, there could actually be more factors at '
                'play.\n',
                'When copyright holders discuss online piracy, they often '
                'highlight the associated losses. However, not all pirated '
                'downloads equal a loss.',
                'While there is certainly a group of pirates who simply refuse '
                'to pay for content, there are also people who simply can’t '
                'afford it. ',
                'This is particularly true for software, which can be rather '
                'pricey. Interestingly, software piracy can also open up a '
                'door to escape from poverty. Mastering coding or editing '
                'skills, for example, allows people to start a business or '
                'join the workforce. ',
                'The Internet is ',
                ' of top designers who started with a piece of pirated '
                'software, mastered their skills, and went on to become a '
                'professional. This raises the question: can software piracy '
                'mitigate poverty?',
                'A ',
                ' published in the Balkan Journal of Social Sciences tries to '
                'provide some insight into the matter. The researchers examine '
                'the effect of software piracy on poverty in developing and '
                'Latin American economies between 2003 and 2017. ',
                'The piracy rate is determined by the per capita usage of '
                'pirated software or the claimed losses. Poverty is measured '
                'through six indicators including the percentage of the '
                'population living below the poverty threshold. ',
                'The overall conclusions based on those data are quite clear. '
                'Higher piracy levels are linked to less poverty. This effect '
                'is consistent and statistically significant for all six '
                'poverty indicators. ',
                '“[T]here is a statistically significant reverse relationship '
                'between usage of pirated software and poverty in all six '
                'poverty models for both developing and Latin American '
                'countries samples,” the researchers write.',
                'This link between piracy and poverty remains intact when the '
                'model is controlled for other variables such as unemployment '
                'and health expenditure. This means that the hypothesis that '
                '“increases in usage of pirated software decrease poverty” '
                'seems likely. ',
                'As highlighted earlier, it would make sense to find such an '
                'effect. That said, the methodology section of the paper is '
                'rather short and there is no discussion section that '
                'elaborates on the findings. However, people should always be '
                'cautious to explain such links as causal effects. ',
                'If we frame the research question the other way around, the '
                'results could also make sense. In other words, does a '
                'decrease in poverty lead to more software piracy?',
                'It’s not hard to imagine that people living far below the '
                'poverty line aren’t particularly concerned with downloading '
                'copies of Photoshop. However, as poverty decreases, they '
                'might be able to buy a computer, which undoubtedly increases '
                'their likelihood of pirating anything at all. ',
                'So perhaps software piracy lowers poverty, while lower '
                'poverty also leads to more piracy. This flywheel effect may '
                'explain the significant results and could be particularly '
                'strong in developing countries.',
                'The paper doesn’t mention this reverse relationship but it '
                'wouldn’t be a surprise if it plays a role here. '
                'Unfortunately, the researchers didn’t respond to our request '
                'for comment, but it might be worth a follow-up study.',

                'the interpreter computes. Usually there is a unique solution, '
                'but “minimum” means having the ‘most’ ⊥’s – in other words, '

                'Ed Ashcroft loved words and wordplay. One day, browsing '
                'through a dictionary or thesaurus, he came across the word '

                'claim and defined eduction as “tagged demand-driven '

                'backwards.',
                'Secondly, pipeline dataflow works fine for many '
                'unsophisticated programs that process data in a '
                'straightforward way. It’s much simpler than eduction and has '
                'much lower overhead. Program analysis could automatically '

                'implementation.',

                'investigate what’s required to make it work.',
                'The first thing we notice its that it doesn’t use storage '
                '(apart from cells on the invisible stack that implements '
                'recursive calls to the evaluation routine).',
                'Not using storage is a bad idea, because it means that the '

                'we record this fact. The warehouse is an associative store '
                'indexed by the pair (V,t). In modern languages like Python or '

                ' primitive.',
                'The second problem is that the warehouse can in theory fill  '
                'up as the computation proceeds. This is less of an issue with '
                'modern computers – even consumer laptops – that have '
                'ridiculous amounts of storage. For  example, the older '
                'MacBook Air I’m using can store over a ',
                ' numbers. The PyLucid interpreter stores everything and never '

                ' after every operation, your JavaScript JIT compiler can skip '
                'the redundant conversions too, and just keep your numbers as '
                'integers the whole time. When the inputs to a division are '
                'known to be integers, and ',
                ' converts it to integer again afterward, then instead of '
                'emitting two conversions to floating point, a floating point '
                'division instruction, and then a conversion to integer, the '
                'JIT can emit a single integer division instruction, just like '
                'a C compiler would. This is pretty miraculous!',
                "All of JavaScript's bitwise operators inherited from C "
                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',
                ' after your arithmetic operations, and for unsigned you use ',
                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '
                'floating-point division of two integers less than 2',
                ' and then converting the result to an integer gives the exact '
                'same result as an integer division instruction in every case. '
                "But the full range of 64 bit integers isn't representable in "
                'double precision floating point, and JavaScript numbers '
                'always have to behave as if they are represented by double '
                "precision floating point values even when that isn't true. "
                "The JIT compiler can't just do 64-bit integer math under the "
                "covers and pretend that it's floating point, because it would "
                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',
                "OK, 64-bit doesn't work, how about 16-bit and 8-bit? Well, on "
                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "

                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '

                '"It [Egyptian art] influenced art in the ancient Near East," '

                'On Mars, manufacturing costs will be higher and consumption '
                'patterns quite different. In particular, Mars production '
                'requires enormous quantities of methane and oxygen to refuel '
                'Starships flying back to Earth, as well as the local '

                'on Earth, such as nitrogen. These are shown in the modified '

                'consumption and production cost modified by several educated '
                'guesses. A city attempting industrial closure with a small '
                'number of people must have extremely high ',
                ' productivity, at least by Earth standards. This implies a '
                'higher ',
                'production cost and consumption. In addition, basic raw '
                'materials are also consumed at much higher rates and costs in '
                'order to fuel both industry and Starships.',
                'Despite these larger numbers, local production of raw '
                'materials still costs less than $100/kg, which is less than '
                'they could ever cost to import even if Starships were free. '
                'This suggests that even in a future where Starship is able to '
                'deliver cargo to the surface of Mars for 20x less than Falcon '
                'can deliver to LEO today, local production is still favored.',
                'Finally, let’s take a look at the same graph, but with costs '
                'determined by import, at a base rate of $200/kg. $200/kg is '
                'extremely ambitious but not physically impossible. ',

                'methane, and water, are beyond ridiculous in an import '

                'an ore body as the whole planet is made of rocks. '

                'equipment with science fiction capabilities.',
                'Mars’ atmosphere provides limitless quantities of nitrogen '
                'and CO2, requiring only an intake, compressor, dust filter, '
                'and cryogenic distillation for separation. A subsurface water '
                'well (either into ice or an aquifer) provides water and, in '
                'turn all the hydrogen needed to synthesize methane (',
                '). Rubble can be processed from generic local regolith, and '
                'will be used in large volumes for thermal and radiation '
                'shielding, road building, cement, and masonry. This is '
                'notable distinct from, eg, titanium, which will require the '
                'discovery of concentrated ore somewhere, plus the creation of '
                'a local mining town to extract and refine the product before '
                'trucking it back to the city. ',
                'Finally, processing all these materials requires the local '
                'generation of electricity, either with large photovoltaic '
                'solar farms, or nuclear power plants. The power requirement '
                'will be around 10 kW/',
                'Because solar farms are essentially two dimensional, panels '
                'can be made extremely thin and light, with a ',
                'panel mass allocation of less than 100 kg. ',
                'Establishing a local supply chain for these generically '
                'available raw materials lowers the cost of marginal '
                'immigration to the point where it’s conceivably possible to '
                'operate a large outpost, similar in scope to ',
                '. Without further local production, annual ',
                'material imports would be around 10 T at a cost of $2m. ',
                'Cutting this mass requirement back by a few orders of '
                'magnitude would enable human immigrants to Mars to rise, as a '
                'fraction of the total mass flux, from about 0.1% to 20% or '
                'more, an increase of a factor of 200. If the McMurdo analog '
                'city housed 1200 people with ',
                ' turnover of 400 every 26 months, roughly 180 Starships would '
                'be needed for resupply and perhaps just two or three for '
                'passenger transport. With the same 7 year tours of duty, the '
                'same sized Starship fleet could support a base with a '
                'population of over 100,000, if Mars-manufacture of basic '
                'commodities permitted the fleet to mostly carry people and '
                'their personal supplies. For reference, a fleet of 185 '
                'Starships would require roughly 500 launches per year for LEO '
                'refilling, and would cost about $7b/year to operate given '
                'launch costs of $10m and single trip cargo Starships costing '
                '$10m to produce. Under this paradigm, growing Starship '
                'production capacity could support a city of a million people '
                'for less than $70b/year, and that’s assuming everyone still '
                'comes home after a 7 year term of duty. If most migrants are '
                'traveling one way, net transport of 150,000 people to Mars '
                'every 26 months would require the production and launch of '
                '400 Starships every launch window, at a total program cost of '
                'just $28b.',
                'Even better, for commodities whose annual ',
                'consumption falls between roughly 10 kg and 10 T, moving '
                'production to Mars is enormously competitive and thus '
                'enormously profitable. While local production of eye-watering '
                'quantities of water, oxygen, methane, aggregate, and nitrogen '
                'is a basic necessity for any kind of viable Mars base, '
                'onshoring production of steel, food staples, plastics, '
                'fasteners, chemicals, glass, copper, and some textiles would '
                'drive the city’s economic engine of expansion. Completing '
                'this transition would lower ',
                'material imports from 10 T to perhaps 20 kg, reducing the '
                'cost of these commodities from $2m to around $100,000. The '
                'Mars city’s average GDP ',
                ' will be at least 10x the US average today, meaning around '

                'up an outpost and piping titanium chloride in liquid water.  '
                'Likewise for various other metals as cations, and for '
                'phosphate and sulfate.  I think most work will be done by '

                'will need to be within a reasonable light-speed lag but not '

                'implicit assumptions, such as how easy it is to insulate a '
                'pipe well enough to keep water liquid for many kilometers.',
                'I’m still guessing that it will mostly be better to process '
                'ordinary rock into differentiated materials, rather than '

                'about how easy it is to get various metals from ordinary '
                'rock.  On Earth, we have lots of kinds of ore and we have '
                'rivers and oceans that give us virtually frictionless '
                'transport on infrastructure that just exists without us '
                'having to do anything.  So of course we mine ore, and we '
                'would even if processing of ordinary whole rock into multiple '
                'useful materials were orders of magnitude easier than even I '
                'am guessing it will be.  ',
                'I’m also optimistic about the price, mass, and versatility of '
                'machinery for precision manufacturing, compared to the cost '
                'of transport to Mars, compared to the cost of producing '
                'mid-tier bulk materials on Mars, and compared to the '
                'difficulty of anticipating exactly what the Martians will '
                'need and want for the time from one launch window to the '
                'next.  So I expect anything that can be precision-machined '
                'from basic materials to be made on Mars almost from the very '
                'beginning.  Engineering and design, after all, are '

                '“It is a sign of the speed at which events are moving that '
                'Hurst and Blackett’s unexpurgated edition of\xa0',
                ', published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler '
                'angle. The obvious intention of the translator’s preface and '
                'notes is to tone down the book’s ferocity and present Hitler '
                'in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was '
                'still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, '
                'and for that the property-owning classes were willing to '
                'forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in '
                'the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a '
                'version of Conservatism.',
                'Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable '
                'after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett’s '
                'edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all '
                'profits would be devoted to the Red Cross. Nevertheless, '
                'simply on the internal evidence of\xa0',
                ', it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken '
                'place in Hitler’s aims and opinions. When one compares his '
                'utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years '
                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '

                'medical equipment, or a connected car, the firmware and '

                'the business or the safety of individuals.',
                'As a result, edge firmware and software typically have long '
                'release cycles with significant hardware-in-the-loop testing. '
                'Firmware and software are usually bundled together and are '
                'only updated on the order of weeks or months. There is a '

                'This is why I find both the execution model and the security '

                'very small, sometimes on the order of bytes, and they are '
                'portable across platforms. In terms of security, WebAssembly '
                'executes in a sandbox and the basic instruction set provides '
                'for nothing more than pure functions—numerical operations on '
                'its own memory. The WebAssembly code cannot read from, or '
                'write to, the file system, open ports, or access shared '
                'memory. The WebAssembly code can take advantage of functions '
                'or variables provided by the host, but only if the host '
                'provides these explicitly through imports. In other words, '
                'the host is in full control of what the WebAssembly code can '
                'do. The host can even limit the memory used or meter the '
                'number of instructions executed by the WebAssembly code. For '
                'building more complex applications that need to open ports or '
                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',
                'The adoption of WebAssembly in the cloud is limited, but it '
                'is more mature than the IoT edge. Both ',
                ' and ',

                ', a messaging infrastructure compatible with the Kafka API, '
                'also adopted WebAssembly to run client code in event streams. '
                'For these vendors, WebAssembly is attractive because it is '
                'portable and sandboxed. Customers can write code in any '
                'language, as long as it compiles to WebAssembly, and because '
                'the vendor is running untrusted code, often in a multi-tenant '
                'environment, the strict sandboxing protects the vendor '
                'against malicious or buggy code, and helps provide tenant '

                'all the way to cloud services. I am excited about WebAssembly '
                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '
                'developer for productivity, portability, and security.',
                'The ability to move computation from the cloud to the edge is '
                'revolutionary. Computation can be developed, tested, and '
                'benchmarked in the cloud using historical data stored in the '
                'cloud, simulated data, or live data streamed or queried from '
                'the IoT device. When you are satisfied with the results, the '
                'code can be moved from the cloud to the edge.',
                ' WebAssembly binaries are small, so they can be stored as '
                'configuration and synchronized to the IoT devices using '
                'existing mechanisms for desired-state configuration '
                'management. This makes it possible  to iterate on edge '
                'computation, reliably and securely, in hours or days, rather '
                'than weeks or months. Even experimental computation, for '
                'example, a new machine learning model, can run at the edge in '
                'shadow mode and report results back to the cloud for '
                'evaluation. In addition to this flexibility, moving '
                'computation to the edge can provide significant costs savings '
                'by taking advantage of existing edge computation, rather than '
                'consuming additional cloud resources.',
                'I have extensive experience with ',
                ', a toolkit for actor-model programming, distributed '
                'computing, and streaming data. Akka has been a wonderful '
                'platform for building reliable and scalable services for IoT. '
                'With Akka, the run-time is abstracted from the developer. The '
                'developer writes pure functions that are then composed into '
                'actors or streams. For actors, the run-time handles '
                'concurrency, distribution, location transparency, and '
                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '
                'binary, when all the developer is really concerned about is '
                'writing the business logic associated with each route. As a '
                'result, developers end up maintaining a lot of boilerplate '
                'and framework code.',
                'To demonstrate the challenge, consider hundreds of services '
                'using an HTTP server compiled into the application binary. '
                'There are likely many different versions depending on when '
                'the application was last compiled and deployed. If there is a '
                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '
                'logic? This would be similar to how host operating systems '
                'can be patched underneath Kubernetes and no one needs to '
                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '
                'model, but with even less boilerplate and richer primitives '
                'for handling messaging, dynamics, failure, and state. '
                'WebAssembly holds a lot of promise in being able to separate '

                'It is still early days for WebAssembly on the edge and in the '
                'cloud. The biggest challenge may be picking a WebAssembly '

                ', ',
                ', ',
                ', and others, all seem like viable options that can be used '
                'as a library from various programming languages. WebAssembly '
                'is portable across run-times, but changing from one host '
                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '
                'portable way, WASI, or another standard built on top of WASI, '
                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '
                'machine. Python, however, feels awkward. If my understanding '
                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '
                'from a language that is strongly typed, supports functional '
                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '
                'language for any new development.',
                'Finally, if your application must take advantage of multiple '
                'cores, support for multi-threading in library run-times is '
                'still new and limited. That said, for many applications, like '
                'numerical computation, WebAssembly is very fast and runs with '
                'native performance. The performance is also very predictable '
                'since there is no garbage collection. Most run-times also '
                'have support for Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) '
                'which use the processor more efficiently for repetitive '
                'calculations on large data sets. For the majority of the '
                'applications I am looking at, multi-threading should not be a '
                'major limitation, and WebAssembly should deliver excellent '
                'and efficient performance.',
                'WebAssembly is portable, can be targeted from multiple '
                'programming languages, has small binaries, runs efficiently, '
                'and has a very strict sandboxing model. This makes it '
                'exciting for IoT:',

                'Explorer. But, out of school and professional necessity, I '
                'had to make the switch to Google Chrome.',
                'For the most part, it worked out for me. It had features that '
                'Firefox at the time didn’t, like being able to sync and '
                'access tabs from other devices or saving all my bookmarks '
                'under a single profile that I could transfer to other '
                'PCs.\xa0',
                'Then over the years, Google became more invasive. It, like '
                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '
                'processing power is especially a problem for laptops or other '
                'devices with very little RAM.',
                'Which is why Mozilla Firefox is such a breath of fresh air, '
                'as it uses much less of your CPU while still delivering a '
                'fast browsing experience. So feel free to have as many tabs '
                'open as you want in Firefox, your device will barely feel the '
                'effects.',

                'Piracy is a controversial topic and research into the effects '
                'of copyright infringement is widely debated as well. A new '
                'academic study adds an interesting angle by suggesting that '
                'software piracy might lower poverty. While this is a '
                'plausible conclusion, there could actually be more factors at '
                'play.\n',
                'When copyright holders discuss online piracy, they often '
                'highlight the associated losses. However, not all pirated '
                'downloads equal a loss.',
                'While there is certainly a group of pirates who simply refuse '
                'to pay for content, there are also people who simply can’t '
                'afford it. ',
                'This is particularly true for software, which can be rather '
                'pricey. Interestingly, software piracy can also open up a '
                'door to escape from poverty. Mastering coding or editing '
                'skills, for example, allows people to start a business or '
                'join the workforce. ',
                'The Internet is ',
                ' of top designers who started with a piece of pirated '
                'software, mastered their skills, and went on to become a '
                'professional. This raises the question: can software piracy '
                'mitigate poverty?',
                'A ',
                ' published in the Balkan Journal of Social Sciences tries to '
                'provide some insight into the matter. The researchers examine '
                'the effect of software piracy on poverty in developing and '
                'Latin American economies between 2003 and 2017. ',
                'The piracy rate is determined by the per capita usage of '
                'pirated software or the claimed losses. Poverty is measured '
                'through six indicators including the percentage of the '
                'population living below the poverty threshold. ',
                'The overall conclusions based on those data are quite clear. '
                'Higher piracy levels are linked to less poverty. This effect '
                'is consistent and statistically significant for all six '
                'poverty indicators. ',
                '“[T]here is a statistically significant reverse relationship '
                'between usage of pirated software and poverty in all six '
                'poverty models for both developing and Latin American '
                'countries samples,” the researchers write.',
                'This link between piracy and poverty remains intact when the '
                'model is controlled for other variables such as unemployment '
                'and health expenditure. This means that the hypothesis that '
                '“increases in usage of pirated software decrease poverty” '
                'seems likely. ',
                'As highlighted earlier, it would make sense to find such an '
                'effect. That said, the methodology section of the paper is '
                'rather short and there is no discussion section that '
                'elaborates on the findings. However, people should always be '
                'cautious to explain such links as causal effects. ',
                'If we frame the research question the other way around, the '
                'results could also make sense. In other words, does a '
                'decrease in poverty lead to more software piracy?',
                'It’s not hard to imagine that people living far below the '
                'poverty line aren’t particularly concerned with downloading '
                'copies of Photoshop. However, as poverty decreases, they '
                'might be able to buy a computer, which undoubtedly increases '
                'their likelihood of pirating anything at all. ',
                'So perhaps software piracy lowers poverty, while lower '
                'poverty also leads to more piracy. This flywheel effect may '
                'explain the significant results and could be particularly '
                'strong in developing countries.',
                'The paper doesn’t mention this reverse relationship but it '
                'wouldn’t be a surprise if it plays a role here. '
                'Unfortunately, the researchers didn’t respond to our request '
                'for comment, but it might be worth a follow-up study.',

                'controlled individually, which makes them really versatile '
                'for use in e.g. home automation. Throughout my home there are '
                'several strips, each adapting their hue to the current time '
                'of day and showing all sorts of information, such as the '
                'current time and rain forecasts using radar data fetched '
                'online. Pretty neat! But how do you get these strips to show '
                'more than just a solid color (i.e. visual effects or '
                'animations), and actually use them as ‘dashboards’ in a '
                'scalable and maintainable way? In this project, I start out '
                'with a simple and robust (but not very powerful) solution, '
                'and end up with a ',
                ' over-engineered, but very flexible solution to this problem '
                'involving a custom programming language and bytecode '
                'instruction set.',
                'The recommended approach for controlling LED strips like this '
                'is by using ',
                '. ESPHome is a service that allows you to compile custom '
                'firmware for ESP8266, which can control LED strips (among '
                'many other things!) and allows for easy integration with ',
                '. The main benefit of ESPHome is easy device management: '
                'remote updating and reconfiguration is fully automated. '
                'Swapping out a broken ESP8266 or board is as easy as '
                'downloading the right firmware image from ESPHome, flashing '
                'it over USB, and swapping the hardware. The ESPHome firmware '
                'allows color and brightness to be set (from e.g. Home '
                'Assistant) for all LEDs at the same time. One way to make an '
                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',
                'Ideally, we would like to send short ‘animations’ or videos '
                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '
                'where the last nibble determines the number of bytes to pop '
                '(conveniently making ‘0x00’ a no-operation). Similary, ‘0x11’ '
                'means ‘push a single byte’ (the byte to be pushed is the next '
                'byte in the code stream), 0x32 means ‘push the next 8 bytes '
                'as two integers’, et cetera. There are also operators (0x8• '
                'are binary operators, e.g. 0x80 is ‘add’ and 0x81 is '
                '‘subtract’) and jump instructions. Finally there are special '
                'instructions that push the length of the LED strip to the '
                'stack (0xe0 = get_length) and to set a pixel (0xe3 = '
                'set_pixel). ',
                'As an example, consider a simple program that loops from '
                '(get_length) down to zero:',
                'Next, I wrote a simple parser in Rust that could read a '
                'simple ‘programming language’ and compile it to the byte code '
                'just defined. For example, the program above can be written '
                'as:',
                'The equivalent of the example script above in this language '
                'would be the following:',
                'In the above, the ‘blit’ keyword tells the controller to send '
                'the LED strip ‘image’ created by the program (by calls to '
                'set_pixel) to the LED strip. The above program would '
                'effectively set all LEDs to yellow (RGB 255, 255, 0). The '
                'byte code for this program is as follows:',
                '17 bytes! (note that this works for strips of any length too. '
                'Nice.).',
                'Executing this code on an ESP8266 is very simply done using a '
                'for loop that iterates over the instructions, a giant switch '
                'statement that determines which instruction it is (based on '
                'the first nibble). The stack is simply an array of 32-bit '
                'integers with a separate value pointing at the last inserted '
                'item. Finally, there is a buffer for the LED data to be '

                'that need to run between each frame). Currently this part is '
                'written in C++ using the Arduino toolkit, so it should be '

                'neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from '

                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '

                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '

                "integer, and you'll get the same number as C did! With a lot "
                "more work. Of course you don't want your bitwise operator to "

                ' converts it to integer again afterward, then instead of '
                'emitting two conversions to floating point, a floating point '
                'division instruction, and then a conversion to integer, the '
                'JIT can emit a single integer division instruction, just like '
                'a C compiler would. This is pretty miraculous!',
                "All of JavaScript's bitwise operators inherited from C "
                'convert their operands and results to 32-bit signed integers. '
                "But there's a trick for unsigned integers too. JavaScript has "
                "one extra bitwise operator that C doesn't have: ",
                '. This is essentially an "unsigned right shift" operator, and '
                'it is special because its result is an unsigned 32-bit '
                'integer. So when you want a signed integer you append ',
                ' after your arithmetic operations, and for unsigned you use ',
                ". That's all there is to it!",
                'So this all works great for 32-bit integer math, both signed '
                'and unsigned. What about other sizes? Unfortunately if you '
                "want 64-bit integer math, you're out of luck. These tricks "
                'work for 32-bit numbers because double precision floating '
                'point can represent every 32-bit integer exactly, and doing a '
                'floating-point division of two integers less than 2',
                ' and then converting the result to an integer gives the exact '
                'same result as an integer division instruction in every case. '
                "But the full range of 64 bit integers isn't representable in "
                'double precision floating point, and JavaScript numbers '
                'always have to behave as if they are represented by double '
                "precision floating point values even when that isn't true. "
                "The JIT compiler can't just do 64-bit integer math under the "
                "covers and pretend that it's floating point, because it would "
                'get different results when the integers are large enough.',
                "OK, 64-bit doesn't work, how about 16-bit and 8-bit? Well, on "
                "the one hand you can't do those either, all your integer math "
                "is going to be 32 bits wide. But on the other hand that isn't "
                'so bad, because CPUs add 32-bit numbers just as fast as 8-bit '
                'numbers. Where smaller types ',
                ' matter is in memory usage. If you want an array of bytes, '
                'but you use a JavaScript array to store JavaScript numbers '
                'instead, it will use 8 times the memory (and 8 times the '
                'memory bandwidth, and 8 times the cache space) because every '
                'JavaScript number is 8 bytes. Thankfully JavaScript has a '
                'solution for this too: typed arrays. Typed arrays can hold '
                '8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values in both signed and unsigned '
                "varieties. As an added benefit, since typed arrays can't hold "
                "object references, the garbage collector doesn't need to scan "
                'their contents, which also helps performance.',
                "Bonus question: what about 32-bit floating point? It's faster "
                'than 64-bit floating point, and used a lot in 3D graphics. '
                'Can we use a similar trick to make the JavaScript JIT emit '
                "32-bit float math instructions? The answer is yes, there's a "
                'function ',

                'for new music declined an additional 1.4%. These old tunes '
                'now represent a staggering 72% of the market.',
                'If this were just a short term blip of nostalgia caused by a '
                'popular TV show, I might ignore these numbers. But every '

                'But when cultures stop innovating, they soon lose the '

                'between the years 312 and 315 AD—when the Empire, for all its '

                'As a result, the builders of this monument had to steal parts '
                'from older structures. You could call it the first reboot, '
                'and it looks a lot like the entertainment business today. '
                'They took works designed to honor earlier emperors—Marcus '
                'Aurelius, Hadrian, Trajan—and pretended they were relevant to '
                'the current situation. The result was what we call '
                'anachronism—when something from a different time period is '
                'placed incoherently in the midst of newer material.',
                'It’s like walking down the street in a suit of armor, or '
                'riding a horse to the supermarket. It might seem amusing at '
                'first, but when you start seeing things like this everyday, '
                'you begin to get worried.',
                'We have now apparently arrived at the Era of Anachronism in '
                'our own creative culture. An 80-year-old man is the star of '
                'an action movie. A tune from a different century is the song '
                'of the summer. Superheroes from the distant days before World '

                'as if it were the most natural thing in the world. And maybe '
                'all this is even entertaining for a while—until you start '
                'asking how this story ends.',
                'But we already know the answer to that. There have been other '
                'periods of artistic stagnation in the past, and they usually '

                '(apart from cells on the invisible stack that implements '

                'modern computers – even consumer laptops – that have '
                'ridiculous amounts of storage. For  example, the older '

                'A number of smart people have tried to fix this, without '
                'success. My hunch is that it can’t be done, though I don’t '

                'they can’t just tell the computer what to do. Furthermore, '
                'implementing Lucid is quite a challenge because you can’t '
                'simply turn Lucid code into machine code.',
                'In fact there are huge advantages to writing in Lucid and '
                'implementing the program with eduction. To begin with',
                '.',
                'The statements in a Lucid program really are mathematical '
                'equations. Inside a ',
                ' clause the order is unimportant and the result of a where '
                'clause is derived from the (usually unique) solution of these '
                'equations. Lucid has evolved but the statements-as-equations '
                'principle has remained nonnegotiable. For example, we do not '
                'allow compound expressions on the left hand side because that '
                'can undermine the basic principle.',
                'For a start we can apply the rules of algebra exactly because '
                'there are no side effects. If X = A+B and A and B are both '
                'small integers, we can conclude that X is also an integer. '
                'And if A and B both increase with time, we can conclude that '
                'so does X. Static analysis of Lucid programs is vastly '
                'simpler than that of imperative languages like Python.',
                ' Also, we can safely apply the transformation rules of '
                'conventional algebra. For example, if ',
                ' we can add an equation ',
                ' (V not already in use) and change the definition of Y to ',
                ' The expression ',
                ' can be replaced by ',
                '; no side effects. Or if ',
                ' is defined to be ',
                ', then ',
                ') can be replaced by',
                ' and then by',
                '.',
                'The ',
                ' proceeds by applying meaning-preserving transformations. In '
                'the end (after introducing Yaghi code) the entire program is '
                'reduced to a (large) unordered set of ‘atomic’ equations By '
                '‘atomic’ we mean that each equation consists of a variable '
                'equated to an expression which is either a data constant or a '
                'single operation applied to variables.',
                'The atomic form is ready for eduction. But it is still a '
                'Lucid program, is human readable and can be saved in a simple '
                'text file. It is semantically equivalent to the original. The '
                'atomic form is also amenable to program analysis, for example '
                'determining dimensionalities.',
                'Once we have the atomic form of the  program, we can store it '
                'on different machines and have a number of warehouses also on '
                'different machines. We could divide up the work according to '
                'variables, e.g. have one machine evaluating A, B, and C, and '
                'another X, Y, and Z.',
                'Of course a demand for say, B could generate a demand for, '
                'say, Z but this demand could  be sent across the network. '
                'Program analysis could tell us how to split up the work so as '
                'to minimize network traffic.',
                'There would be no  problem duplicating warehouse entries '
                'because you are never going to have discrepancies – you can '
                'use whichever warehouse you want.',
                'With eduction the program does not change – unlike systems '
                'based, say, on combinator reduction. If a value goes missing '
                'for whatever reason, it can be recomputed (although this may '
                'be expensive in terms of time). For this reason the warehouse '
                'strategy can be only a heuristic, like the retirement plan.',
                'Fault tolerance is vital for a distributed implementation '
                'because it means communications don’t have to be 100% '
                'reliable.',
                'Eduction has plenty of provision for parallelism. There is no '
                'inherent contention between demanding a value of X and '
                'demanding a value of  Y, unless (say) the demand for X '
                'generates a demand for Y (at the same coordinate). There are '
                'no races because there are no side effects.',
                'The GLU project used Lucid as a coordination language to link '
                'pieces of legacy C code. They achieved modest speed up, '
                'typically an order of magnitude. This was back in the 90s '
                'when computers were pathetically weak (in terms of speed and '
                'storage) compared to today. Surely we can do much better.',

                'In 1986, the band "The Bangles" sang about "all the old '
                'paintings on the tombs" where the figures they depict are '
                '"walking like an Egyptian." Though he was neither an art '
                'historian nor an Egyptologist, songwriter Liam Sternberg was '
                'referring to one of the most striking features of ',
                ' visual art — the depiction of people, animals and objects on '
                'a flat, two-dimensional plane. Why did the ancient Egyptians '
                'do this? And is ancient Egypt the only culture to create art '
                'in this style?',
                'Drawing any object in three dimensions requires a specific '
                'viewpoint to create the illusion of perspective on a flat '
                'surface. Drawing an object in two dimensions (height and '
                'breadth) requires the artist to depict just one surface of '
                'that object. And highlighting just one surface, it turns out, '
                'has its advantages.',
                '"In pictorial representation, the outline carries the most '
                'information," John Baines, professor emeritus of Egyptology '
                'at the University of Oxford in the U.K. told Live Science. '
                '"It\'s easier to understand something if it is defined by an '
                'outline."\xa0',
                'When drawing on a flat surface, the outline becomes the most '
                'important feature, even though many Egyptian drawings and '
                'paintings include details from several sides of the object. '
                '"There is also a great focus on clarity and '
                'comprehensibility," Baines said.',
                'In many artistic traditions, "size equals importance," '
                'according to Baines. In wall art, royalty and tomb owners are '
                'often depicted much larger than the objects surrounding them. '
                'If an artist were to use a three-dimensional perspective to '
                'render human proportions in a realistic scene with a '
                'foreground and background, it would go against this '
                'principle.',
                'The other reason for depicting many objects on a flat, '
                'two-dimensional plane is that it aids the creation of a '
                'visual narrative.\xa0',
                '"One only has to think of [a] comic strip as a parallel," '
                'Baines said. There are widely accepted principles that '
                'organize how ancient Egyptian visual art was created and '
                'interpreted. "In origin, writing was in vertical columns and '
                'pictures were horizontal," Baines said. The hieroglyphic '
                'captions "give you information that is not so easily put in a '
                'picture." More often, these scenes don\'t represent actual '
                'events "but a generalized and idealized representation of '
                'life."\xa0',
                'However, not all pictorial representation in ancient Egypt '
                'was purely two-dimensional. According to Baines, "Most '
                'pictorial art was placed in an architectural setting." Some '
                'compositions on the walls of tombs included relief modeling, '
                'also known as bas relief, in which a mostly flat sculpture is '
                'carved into a wall or mounted onto a wall. In the tomb of '
                'Akhethotep, a royal official who lived during the Fifth '
                'Dynasty around 2400 B.C., we can see two scribes (shown '
                'below) whose bodies are sculpted into the flat surface of the '
                'wall. As Baines explained, the "relief also models the body '
                'surface so you can\'t say that it\'s a flat outline" because '
                '"they have texturing and surface detail in addition to their '
                'outlines."\xa0',
                'In many examples dating as far back as 2700 B.C. in the Early '
                'Dynastic Period, artists painted on top of a relief to add '
                'even more detail, as seen in the image of the two scribes '
                'below.',
                '—',
                '—',
                '—',
                'Egyptian visual art used "more or less universal human '
                'approaches to representation on a flat surface," Baines '
                'said.\xa0',
                '"It [Egyptian art] influenced art in the ancient Near East," '
                'such as ancient Syrian (or Levantine) and ',
                ' art, Baines said. The same conventions can be seen in many '
                'other ancient traditions of art. ',
                ' art also uses pictorial scenes and hieroglyphic script. '
                'Although classical Greek and ',
                ' art is an exception, there are even examples of similar '
                'artistic conventions for two-dimensional drawing and painting '
                'from medieval Europe. As Baines explained, "It\'s a system '

                'Hosting countless Spaghetti Westerns, the spot was so '
                'ubiquitous with the form of filmmaking that three significant '

                'tourist attraction until a hotel group bought them out many '
                'years later. Still running to this day, the park features '
                'daily cowboy stunt shows, mock bank raids, an abandoned gold '

                '“It is a sign of the speed at which events are moving that '
                'Hurst and Blackett’s unexpurgated edition of\xa0',
                ', published only a year ago, is edited from a pro-Hitler '
                'angle. The obvious intention of the translator’s preface and '
                'notes is to tone down the book’s ferocity and present Hitler '
                'in as kindly a light as possible. For at that date Hitler was '
                'still respectable. He had crushed the German labour movement, '
                'and for that the property-owning classes were willing to '
                'forgive him almost anything. Both Left and Right concurred in '
                'the very shallow notion that National Socialism was merely a '
                'version of Conservatism.',
                'Then suddenly it turned out that Hitler was not respectable '
                'after all. As one result of this, Hurst and Blackett’s '
                'edition was reissued in a new jacket explaining that all '
                'profits would be devoted to the Red Cross. Nevertheless, '
                'simply on the internal evidence of\xa0',
                ', it is difficult to believe that any real change has taken '
                'place in Hitler’s aims and opinions. When one compares his '
                'utterances of a year or so ago with those made fifteen years '
                'earlier, a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of his '
                'mind, the way in which his world-view\xa0',
                '\xa0develop. It is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not '
                'likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of '
                'power politics. Probably, in Hitler’s own mind, the '
                'Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of '
                'time-table. The plan laid down in\xa0',
                '\xa0was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of '
                'smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, '
                'England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was '
                'the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia’s turn will '
                'come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is '
                'how Hitler sees it. Whether it will turn out that way is of '
                'course a different question.',
                'Suppose that Hitler’s programme could be put into effect. '
                'What he envisages, a hundred years hence, is a continuous '
                'state of 250 million Germans with plenty of ‘living room’ '
                '(i.e. stretching to Afghanistan or thereabouts), a horrible '
                'brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens '
                'except the training of young men for war and the endless '
                'breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able '
                'to put this monstrous vision across? It is easy to say that '
                'at one stage of his career he was financed by the heavy '
                'industrialists, who saw in him the man who would smash the '
                'Socialists and Communists. They would not have backed him, '
                'however, if he had not talked a great movement into existence '
                'already. Again, the situation in Germany, with its seven '
                'million unemployed, was obviously favourable for demagogues. '
                'But Hitler could not have succeeded against his many rivals '
                'if it had not been for the attraction of his own personality, '
                'which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of\xa0',
                ', and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears his '
                'speeches … The fact is that there is something deeply '
                'appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his '
                'photographs—and I recommend especially the photograph at the '
                'beginning of Hurst and Blackett’s edition, which shows Hitler '
                'in his early Brownshirt days. It is a pathetic, dog-like '
                'face, the face of a man suffering under intolerable wrongs. '
                'In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of '
                'innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little '
                'doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, '
                'personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only '
                'be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is '
                'the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the '
                'self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against '
                'impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how '
                'to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, '
                'that he is fighting against destiny, that he\xa0',
                '\xa0win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction '
                'of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one '
                'sees turn upon some such theme.',
                'Also he has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to '
                'life. Nearly all western thought since the last war, '
                'certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that '
                'human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and '
                'avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, '
                'for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The '
                'Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is '
                'usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute '
                'for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do. Hitler, '
                'because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional '
                'strength, knows that human beings\xa0',
                'only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, '
                'birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at '
                'least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not '
                'to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades. However they may '
                'be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are '
                'psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of '
                'life. The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised '
                'version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have '
                'enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their '
                'peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more '
                'grudging way, have said to people ‘I offer you a good time,’ '
                'Hitler has said to them ‘I offer you struggle, danger and '
                'death,’ and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his '
                'feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change '
                'their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years '
                'of slaughter and starvation ‘Greatest happiness of the '
                'greatest number’ is a good slogan, but at this moment ‘Better '
                'an end with horror than a horror without end’ is a winner. '

                'topic here to have another go and to help future readers, '
                'including me, get quantitative on this subject.',
                'There are three intuitions which underlie this discussion. ',
                'A less terrible version of the diagram is given below.',
                'The diagram shows a mix of industrial sectors (eg all steel) '
                'and also particular products as representatives of entire '
                'sectors (beyond burger for highly processed food). These '
                'products are graphed according to their annual ',
                ' consumption (horizontal axis) and annual ',
                ' cost (vertical axis). On the far right we have water, which '
                'is incredibly cheap despite us using far more of it than '
                'anything else. As we trend to the left, we traverse steadily '
                'more sophisticated products with higher unit costs and lower '
                'production volumes. ',
                'On Mars, manufacturing costs will be higher and consumption '
                'patterns quite different. In particular, Mars production '
                'requires enormous quantities of methane and oxygen to refuel '
                'Starships flying back to Earth, as well as the local '
                'production of materials which are scarce on Mars but common '
                'on Earth, such as nitrogen. These are shown in the modified '
                'graph below.',
                'This graph shows all the same commodities with Mars '
                'consumption and production cost modified by several educated '
                'guesses. A city attempting industrial closure with a small '
                'number of people must have extremely high ',
                ' productivity, at least by Earth standards. This implies a '
                'higher ',
                'production cost and consumption. In addition, basic raw '
                'materials are also consumed at much higher rates and costs in '
                'order to fuel both industry and Starships.',
                'Despite these larger numbers, local production of raw '
                'materials still costs less than $100/kg, which is less than '
                'they could ever cost to import even if Starships were free. '
                'This suggests that even in a future where Starship is able to '
                'deliver cargo to the surface of Mars for 20x less than Falcon '
                'can deliver to LEO today, local production is still favored.',
                'Finally, let’s take a look at the same graph, but with costs '
                'determined by import, at a base rate of $200/kg. $200/kg is '
                'extremely ambitious but not physically impossible. ',
                'At $200/kg, the cost of nearly every import falls on the '
                'green diagonal, indicating that importation is the major cost '
                'driver. Indeed, very few commodities have higher unit prices '

                'The first thing to notice is that the ',
                'costs for basic raw materials such as rubble, oxygen, '
                'methane, and water, are beyond ridiculous in an import '
                'scenario. For industrial scale water consumption without '
                'recycling, annual water imports alone are about $10b/',
                '. ',
                'In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) is absolutely mandatory '
                'from the very beginning for any material in the top right '
                'section of the graph, including nitrogen, concrete, oxygen, '
                'rubble, methane, and water. Fortunately, all of these '
                'materials are readily obtained almost anywhere on Mars, and '
                'many of them can be obtained via pipelines in non '
                'solid-phase. For crushed rocks, it is not necessary to find '
                'an ore body as the whole planet is made of rocks. '
                'Importantly, none of these materials will require incredibly '
                'sophisticated remotely operated robotic mining and refining '
                'equipment with science fiction capabilities.',
                'Mars’ atmosphere provides limitless quantities of nitrogen '
                'and CO2, requiring only an intake, compressor, dust filter, '
                'and cryogenic distillation for separation. A subsurface water '
                'well (either into ice or an aquifer) provides water and, in '
                'turn all the hydrogen needed to synthesize methane (',
                '). Rubble can be processed from generic local regolith, and '
                'will be used in large volumes for thermal and radiation '
                'shielding, road building, cement, and masonry. This is '
                'notable distinct from, eg, titanium, which will require the '
                'discovery of concentrated ore somewhere, plus the creation of '
                'a local mining town to extract and refine the product before '
                'trucking it back to the city. ',
                'Finally, processing all these materials requires the local '
                'generation of electricity, either with large photovoltaic '
                'solar farms, or nuclear power plants. The power requirement '
                'will be around 10 kW/',
                'Because solar farms are essentially two dimensional, panels '
                'can be made extremely thin and light, with a ',
                'panel mass allocation of less than 100 kg. ',
                'Establishing a local supply chain for these generically '
                'available raw materials lowers the cost of marginal '

                'operate a large outpost, similar in scope to ',
                '. Without further local production, annual ',
                'material imports would be around 10 T at a cost of $2m. ',
                'Cutting this mass requirement back by a few orders of '
                'magnitude would enable human immigrants to Mars to rise, as a '
                'fraction of the total mass flux, from about 0.1% to 20% or '
                'more, an increase of a factor of 200. If the McMurdo analog '
                'city housed 1200 people with ',
                ' turnover of 400 every 26 months, roughly 180 Starships would '
                'be needed for resupply and perhaps just two or three for '
                'passenger transport. With the same 7 year tours of duty, the '
                'same sized Starship fleet could support a base with a '
                'population of over 100,000, if Mars-manufacture of basic '
                'commodities permitted the fleet to mostly carry people and '
                'their personal supplies. For reference, a fleet of 185 '
                'Starships would require roughly 500 launches per year for LEO '
                'refilling, and would cost about $7b/year to operate given '
                'launch costs of $10m and single trip cargo Starships costing '
                '$10m to produce. Under this paradigm, growing Starship '
                'production capacity could support a city of a million people '
                'for less than $70b/year, and that’s assuming everyone still '
                'comes home after a 7 year term of duty. If most migrants are '
                'traveling one way, net transport of 150,000 people to Mars '
                'every 26 months would require the production and launch of '
                '400 Starships every launch window, at a total program cost of '
                'just $28b.',
                'Even better, for commodities whose annual ',
                'consumption falls between roughly 10 kg and 10 T, moving '
                'production to Mars is enormously competitive and thus '
                'enormously profitable. While local production of eye-watering '
                'quantities of water, oxygen, methane, aggregate, and nitrogen '
                'is a basic necessity for any kind of viable Mars base, '
                'onshoring production of steel, food staples, plastics, '
                'fasteners, chemicals, glass, copper, and some textiles would '
                'drive the city’s economic engine of expansion. Completing '
                'this transition would lower ',
                'material imports from 10 T to perhaps 20 kg, reducing the '
                'cost of these commodities from $2m to around $100,000. The '
                'Mars city’s average GDP ',
                ' will be at least 10x the US average today, meaning around '
                '$650,000. Import costs, while still substantial and '
                'unbalanced, will be less than 15% of total economic activity.',
                'What about commodities with consumption below 10 kg/',
                '? For the most part, these are high specific cost items whose '
                'importation cost penalty is roughly the same as the Mars '
                'manufacturing difficulty penalty. That is, there is no strong '
                'economic reason to onshore production. There are '
                'non-economic, strategic reasons to onshore at least partial '
                'local production of 6502 processors or electric motors, but '
                'it’s unlikely to be wildly profitable without some kind of '
                'import tariff. ',
                'Indeed, a 4-9 month interplanetary voyage on Starship would '
                'require a few hundred kilograms of consumables per passenger, '
                'plus a personal luggage allocation of a similar size. So it '
                'is conceivable that each migrant could bring with them a ',
                ' of underwear, flash memory, and pharmaceuticals, without '
                'significantly affecting the per-passenger mass overhead. In '
                'other words, once ~80 kg people and their life support '
                'equipment become the dominant form of transported freight, '
                'extremely high value and low mass high tech and luxury items '
                'do not consume much marginal capacity. ',
                'While this analysis has been prepared using a Mars cargo '
                'transport cost of $200/kg, the results do not vary much even '
                'as this changes. Commodities split into three categories: raw '
                'material (local production mandatory), secondary commodities '
                '(local production profitable) and high tech/luxury goods '
                '(local production requires tariffs). The precise boundaries '
                'between these three categories do not even move much for a '
                'range of plausible shipping costs. Essentially anything that '
                'can be made from water, Mars atmosphere, or surface rocks '
                'must always be made locally. Anything simpler than textiles '
                'is profitable to produce on Mars. And anything requiring '
                'precision manufacturing is probably cheaper to import in '
                'bulk. ',
                'Let’s make this observation concrete. ',
                'Shipping costs can climb to $2000/kg, creating more of an '
                'economic driver to produce, eg, bearings and motors on Mars. '
                'Yet the ',
                'consumption is still around 10 kg/year, so the total local '
                'addressable market for local production is small while total '
                'importation costs are still quite low in the overall grand '
                'scheme. ',
                'Alternatively, shipping costs could fall to $10/kg. This '
                'would require several large miracles in Earth-based fuel '
                'costs and Starship production, and for what? Local oxygen '
                'production would become less compelling, but the city would '
                'still require 30 T/',
                'annually, which would swamp the entire cargo manifest. ',
                'Fundamentally, any Mars city construction is going to cost a '
                'lot of money, essentially determined by the rate of Starship '
                'launches. The goal of the mission planners is to maximize the '
                'return on investment given by those several thousand cargo '
                'transport missions. Given some finite cargo capacity to '
                'maximize the rate and number of economically productive '
                'migrants, it will always be necessary to do massive scale '
                'Mars-based fuel ISRU production, along with related basic '
                'products. Once this exists, return flights and a population '
                'of thousands is possible. Their task is to diversify the '
                'local supply chain and build out the middle tranche of basic '
                'industrial commodities. But no matter how cheap Starships '
                'get, localizing production of, eg, computer chips will '
                'consume scarce labor without necessarily improving the '
                'migration rate. ',
                'Ultimately, a self-sustaining Mars city must be able to '
                'produce everything it needs locally. During the scaling '
                'phase, however, there will come a time when the make-buy '

                'With large expandable space habitats the pressurized volume '
                'to hold all this could easily be less then one ton per capita '

                'in the “everything else” category.',
                'Water is obviously the big deal in the budget so effort '
                'should be made to get it down.  It’s a large closed volume so '
                'it should be possible to recycle water much more efficiently '
                'then a small space vessel.  If you get it down to just a '
                'couple tons of water and oxygen a year you’d be getting '
                'almost all you’d need in the food imports.  At this point '
                'launch costs start mattering less then the costs of the goods '
                'imported.  American per capita consumption expenditures are '
                '$64,000 a year.  Of that %70 is spending on services so '
                'that’s roughly $20,000 of physical goods from the outside.  '
                'The city would presumably be a net exporter of services '

                'the population working in R+D and entertainment industries '

                'people live in large expensive cities because they prefer '
                'them to alternatives that are cheaper. Same would certainly '

                'People would pay (perhaps much) more to live there than in '

                'human time spent detaching-packing-loading raptors to ship '

                'It’s less that I think it makes sense to ship the Raptors '
                'back, as it’s about the only thing besides scientific samples '
                'and the rare return passenger that might make sense to send '

                'Essentially the whole Starship aside from the engines is '
                'going to be high value parts and materials that you could use '
                'on Mars, and even the raptors might be more valuable for '
                'their material content than as engines.',
                'I can’t see shipping Raptors back to Earth as being more '
                'interesting than using the Martian Raptors for voyages to '
                'Jupiter, or further out. Mars seems like the obvious '
                'refuelling point for outer system exploration. I have no idea '

                'on machinery than it is on our warm, moist planet.  But I '
                'like the idea of pipelines.  If titanium is much easier to '

                'will need to be within a reasonable light-speed lag but not '
                'directly on-site.  Of course, I may be wrong about many '
                'implicit assumptions, such as how easy it is to insulate a '
                'pipe well enough to keep water liquid for many kilometers.',
                'I’m still guessing that it will mostly be better to process '
                'ordinary rock into differentiated materials, rather than '
                'leaving it as crushed whole rock.  I’m fairly optimistic '
                'about how easy it is to get various metals from ordinary '
                'rock.  On Earth, we have lots of kinds of ore and we have '
                'rivers and oceans that give us virtually frictionless '
                'transport on infrastructure that just exists without us '
                'having to do anything.  So of course we mine ore, and we '
                'would even if processing of ordinary whole rock into multiple '
                'useful materials were orders of magnitude easier than even I '
                'am guessing it will be.  ',
                'I’m also optimistic about the price, mass, and versatility of '
                'machinery for precision manufacturing, compared to the cost '
                'of transport to Mars, compared to the cost of producing '
                'mid-tier bulk materials on Mars, and compared to the '
                'difficulty of anticipating exactly what the Martians will '
                'need and want for the time from one launch window to the '

                'perform IO, there is the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) '
                'which defines a standard set of system imports while still '
                'providing sandboxed execution. However, as I will describe '
                'more below, I am most interested in WebAssembly for pure '
                'functions with no side effects.',
                'Considering a concrete example will help. Consider an '
                'electric water heater that responds to the cost of '
                'electricity and avoids heating when power is the most '
                'expensive, while still predicting and respecting the '
                'customer’s typical usage. The business logic that determines '
                'the control setpoint might be a simple state machine or an '
                'intensive numerical computation that solves an optimization '
                'problem. In either case, it is a pure function with no side '
                'effects. The software running on the water heater gathers the '
                'input data (e.g., price forecast, historical usage, time of '
                'day) and performs all necessary IO. It passes the inputs to '
                'the setpoint function and, based on the output, performs the '
                'necessary actuation.',
                'What if you want to modify the setpoint function to improve '
                'the optimization? If the software and the firmware are '
                'bundled together, there is no way to update it without going '
                'through a full testing and release cycle. But if the setpoint '
                'function was a WebAssembly module, it could be updated '
                'flexibly, without a new firmware release. The code can be '
                'signed so we know it is from a trusted source. We also know '
                'the code cannot do anything malicious, like modify host '
                'memory or write to the file system, because it is sandboxed. '
                'Some might be concerned about the WebAssembly code providing '
                'a bad setpoint, either maliciously or through a programming '
                'error, but the safety critical firmware must protect against '
                'this already, even if the software cannot be updated at '
                'run-time. The distinction is that the setpoint function is '
                'only providing the setpoint—the firmware must still ensure '
                'the setpoint is within acceptable bounds that may be '
                'determined by physical or regulatory constraints.',
                'When I share my excitement for this approach, most people are '
                'sceptical of WebAssembly and suggest alternatives. '
                'Unquestionably, WebAssembly is not required to update '
                'software at run-time—one could download a standalone binary '
                'or a Docker container, verify it is signed and from a trusted '
                'source, and sandbox its execution through systemd or the '
                'configuration of the container run-time. However, as '
                'demonstrated by the ',
                ' attack, supply-chain attacks can render even trusted code '
                'vulnerable. WebAssembly should be far safer, especially for '
                'pure functions, because its instruction set is so limited, '
                'and its security model is restrictive rather than opt-in.',
                ' Setting aside the security challenges, if you need to '
                'support heterogeneous devices, the binaries would need to be '
                'compiled for the target architecture and there is no '
                'portability. Binaries and containers can also be large, on '
                'the order of megabytes, and downloading them can be slow and '
                'incur significant transmission costs. Finally, running a '
                'binary or a container to execute a pure function has '
                'significant penalties for resource consumption and start-up '
                'time.',
                ' In the limit, trying to address all of these issues—small '
                'binaries, fast execution, portability, strict sandboxing, '
                'metering execution—feels like reinventing WebAssembly.',
                'Why I am excited about WebAssembly for the IoT edge:',

                'in the cloud for two reasons: 1) moving code from the cloud '
                'to the edge for interoperability, fast iteration, and cost '
                'savings, and 2) abstracting the cloud run-time from the '
                'developer for productivity, portability, and security.',
                'The ability to move computation from the cloud to the edge is '
                'revolutionary. Computation can be developed, tested, and '
                'benchmarked in the cloud using historical data stored in the '
                'cloud, simulated data, or live data streamed or queried from '
                'the IoT device. When you are satisfied with the results, the '
                'code can be moved from the cloud to the edge.',
                ' WebAssembly binaries are small, so they can be stored as '
                'configuration and synchronized to the IoT devices using '
                'existing mechanisms for desired-state configuration '
                'management. This makes it possible  to iterate on edge '
                'computation, reliably and securely, in hours or days, rather '
                'than weeks or months. Even experimental computation, for '
                'example, a new machine learning model, can run at the edge in '
                'shadow mode and report results back to the cloud for '
                'evaluation. In addition to this flexibility, moving '
                'computation to the edge can provide significant costs savings '
                'by taking advantage of existing edge computation, rather than '
                'consuming additional cloud resources.',
                'I have extensive experience with ',
                ', a toolkit for actor-model programming, distributed '
                'computing, and streaming data. Akka has been a wonderful '
                'platform for building reliable and scalable services for IoT. '
                'With Akka, the run-time is abstracted from the developer. The '
                'developer writes pure functions that are then composed into '
                'actors or streams. For actors, the run-time handles '
                'concurrency, distribution, location transparency, and '
                'failure. For streaming, the run-time handles the dynamics '
                'through asynchronous backpressure and the ',
                ' standard. The details are too involved to describe here, but '
                'I have written about this in the past, including how Akka '
                'enables digital twins for IoT devices through lightweight '
                'actors.',
                ' Despite these great abstractions, after developing a large '
                'number of services, updating the run-time becomes a '
                'significant burden, because the run-time itself is compiled '
                'into application binaries. This is certainly not unique to '
                'Akka. Most applications that have a simple HTTP or a gRPC '
                'interface have the server compiled into the application '
                'binary, when all the developer is really concerned about is '
                'writing the business logic associated with each route. As a '
                'result, developers end up maintaining a lot of boilerplate '
                'and framework code.',
                'To demonstrate the challenge, consider hundreds of services '
                'using an HTTP server compiled into the application binary. '
                'There are likely many different versions depending on when '
                'the application was last compiled and deployed. If there is a '
                'security vulnerably identified in a specific version of the '
                'HTTP server, what services need to be patched and where are '
                'they running? This is not an easy question to answer.',
                ' Most people attack this problem with tooling, but what if '
                'the run-time could be updated independently from the business '
                'logic? This would be similar to how host operating systems '
                'can be patched underneath Kubernetes and no one needs to '
                'care, as long as the pods are rescheduled on another host.',
                'It would be great to have a high-level run-time like Akka but '
                'abstracted entirely outside of the code the developer writes. '
                'You can think of this as a Functions as a Service (FaaS) '

                'is portable across run-times, but changing from one host '
                'run-time to another would be a major investment once a '
                'significant amount of code or tooling has been developed. If '
                'WebAssembly is only used for pure functions, however, porting '
                'code from one host run-time to another may be relatively '
                'straightforward. While such active development is exciting, '
                'it will be beneficial for the industry to consolidate around '
                'a small number of ubiquitous run-times. Some people will be '
                'concerned about the experience of debugging and '
                'troubleshooting, but I think this is of minor concern when '
                'using WebAssembly for pure functions.',
                'Selecting a cloud run-time will depend largely on the type of '
                'workload you want to run. For example, do you want to run '
                'pure functions, entities that need to maintain state (e.g., '
                'digital twins), services that need to interact with databases '
                'or streaming data, or do you want to evaluate your '
                'WebAssembly code for the edge running in the same host '
                'run-time? As the cloud ecosystem for WebAssembly becomes '
                'richer, as long as your code is WebAssembly and WASI '
                'compliant, it should be portable to another run-time. '
                'However, for the cloud to abstract interacting with '
                'databases, key-value stores, message buses, etc., in a '
                'portable way, WASI, or another standard built on top of WASI, '
                'needs to include these interfaces. WASI is important to '
                'enable many applications, but it might be the wrong layer of '
                'abstraction for most developers.',
                'Part of the appeal of WebAssembly is that it can be targeted '
                'by many different programming languages. Legacy code can also '
                'be ported to WebAssembly. If the legacy code is C or C++, '
                'WebAssembly is arguably a safer environment for execution '
                'given the limited instruction set and stack-based virtual '
                'machine. Python, however, feels awkward. If my understanding '
                'is correct, since Python is an interpreted language, the '
                'interpreter must also be included in the WebAssembly code. '
                'Given a choice, I would much prefer to program WebAssembly '
                'from a language that is strongly typed, supports functional '
                'programming, affords compile-time memory safety, and has '
                'great tooling. Rust seems to be by far the most attractive '
                'language for any new development.',
                'Finally, if your application must take advantage of multiple '

                'For the most part, it worked out for me. It had features that '
                'Firefox at the time didn’t, like being able to sync and '
                'access tabs from other devices or saving all my bookmarks '
                'under a single profile that I could transfer to other '
                'PCs.\xa0',
                'Then over the years, Google became more invasive. It, like '
                'many other major corporations, started tracking and compiling '
                'data and creating detailed profiles that it could sell to '
                'marketing firms. Lucrative business for them, but a nail in '
                'the coffin for internet privacy.\xa0',
                'The other nail is the fact that Chrome’s market share has '
                'absolutely skyrocketed during this period of time. Back in '
                '2008 when I first made the switch, Google and Mozilla weren’t '
                'too far apart but now, thanks to most other browsers using '
                'some form of Chromium to power them, the gap might as well be '
                'an ocean.',
                'But I’m here to tell you that it doesn’t have to be that way. '
                'I finally switched back to Mozilla Firefox in 2019 and found '
                'it to be an incredible browser that had every feature Chrome '
                'had and more.',
                'Google Chrome has an array of AdBlock extensions that keeps '
                'your data out of the hands of marketing firms looking to '
                'compile detailed profiles made of your browsing history. '
                'However, the Chrome browser itself does the same and there’s '
                'no restricting that access. There are also talks of Google '
                'breaking those AdBlock extensions in 2023 with a massive '
                'update, which is rather terrifying, to say the least.',
                'However, Mozilla has none of these issues. The browser '
                'doesn’t track you in the slightest and even has built-in '
                'cookie protection and offers VPN services for a low price. So '
                'you can add AdBlock or uBlock Origins or whichever other '
                'extension you prefer, knowing the Firefox will not violate '
                'your privacy.',
                'While Google Chrome has a good selection of extensions, '
                'Mozilla Firefox has far more than that and a sizable amount '
                'is devoted to blocking the vast array of internet trackers '
                'used by most sites. And unlike Chrome, Firefox is extremely '
                'anti-tracking to the point that outside forces (whether work '
                'or school) are unable to install tracking extensions and '
                'programs into the browser.',
                'These are some Firefox extensions in particular that are, in '
                'my humble opinion, vital to the best possible browsing '
                'experience:',
                'Not only are all of these useful for keeping all your data '
                'safe and private, but it’s truly sobering just how much of '
                'your online experience is being recorded at any given moment.',
                'One of the features I needed when I switched to Chrome was '
                'the ability to sync and open the same tabs on different '
                'devices, a feature that later proved indispensable throughout '
                'college and especially when I first began writing '
                'professionally as a video game journalist. And being able to '
                'save all my bookmarks was vital to me not losing access to '
                'them in case of a PC failure, ironically what happened when '
                'my laptop broke down and I lost all my Mozilla Firefox '
                'bookmarks.',
                'But now Firefox has all of these and it’s incredibly simple '
                'to use. The browser itself saves your bookmarks and settings '
                'under one profile, which you can transfer to multiple PCs and '
                'even the mobile version of the browser. From there you can '
                'sync tabs between all your devices and open them wherever you '
                'want. You can even send tabs directly from one device to '
                'another, allowing you to instantly open them without digging '
                'around first. And all bookmarks are saved under your profile, '
                'giving you full access to them across any device once you log '
                'in.',
                'A huge complaint among even the most stalwart ',
                ' users is that the browser eats through your CPU like a '
                'Snorlax at a buffet. While this is an issue for any PC, '
                'having a browser that consistently takes up almost half your '
                'processing power is especially a problem for laptops or other '
                'devices with very little RAM.',
                'Which is why Mozilla Firefox is such a breath of fresh air, '
                'as it uses much less of your CPU while still delivering a '
                'fast browsing experience. So feel free to have as many tabs '

                'not sure why this is, but maybe people don’t like change?',

                'libraries. C++ added its standard library rather late in the '

                'who are backed by powerful figures. Thanks to the progress of '

                ' when they were children, it might have come across as a loud '
                'and dumb, all-guns-blazing flick but Verhoeven’s films are '

                ', Verhoeven even claimed that the film is a Biblical allegory '
                'where a cyborg policeman is the future embodiment of an '
                'American Jesus. ',
                'Read More',
                'Verhoeven explained: “I started to look at the movie in those '
                'terms – and I’m not a Christian. It was one of the reasons I '
                'have RoboCop walking over water when he kills Clarence '
                'Boddicker, the bad guy, at the end. I felt he was like the '
                'American Jesus – whereas Boddicker is evil personified. We '
                'even gave Boddicker glasses so he looked a bit like Heinrich '

                'inevitable. The bio-engineered transformation of Murphy into '

                'Through the story of a robot who dreams and has memories, '
                'Verhoeven navigates the wasteland of a morally and '

                'apprehension about the future of our civilisation with '

                'brutality and authoritarian control in the US, it is tragic '

                'neurons in the brain’s outer layer. As a result, data from '
                'the UK Biobank which contains information on nearly 500,000 '

                'Approximately 32,000 individuals’ neuroimaging (MRI) results '

                'including memory and reaction time as well as less grey '
                'matter in several areas of the brain.',
                'These regions included the hippocampus, which is a crucial '

                'living alone or far from family members increased the chance '
                'of loneliness. People who are unsatisfied with their social '
                'and family\xa0lives are also more likely to say they are '

                'In contrast, important protective factors against loneliness '
                'include having a partner, having meaningful daily '
                'interactions and having minimal social anxiety. Long-term '
                'illness, disability, transportation problems, unemployment or '
                'exposure to domestic or public violence are just a few '

                'The most robust evidence on social connection, isolation, '

                'would severely curtail their functionality (e.g. Day One, '
                'Grammarly). The second category is apps that I purchased '
                'outright and have a hybrid approach where they receive '
                'updates for a while (e.g. one year) after purchase. For these '
                'apps, receiving new updates and features requires purchasing '
                'another year of updates, but most existing features prior to '
                'that date remain fully functional. Apps like Agenda, Nova, & '
                'CleanShot X follow this model. And finally, the third '
                'category is subscription applications I purchased a lifetime '
                'license for. This tier is often 2-5x the cost of an annual '
                'subscription, but it gives me access to the app and all its '
                'features for as long as it is supported. Apps like Calm, '

 'paragraphs': ['Digital RGB LED strips are strips of LED lights that can be '
                'controlled individually, which makes them really versatile '
                'for use in e.g. home automation. Throughout my home there are '
                'several strips, each adapting their hue to the current time '
                'of day and showing all sorts of information, such as the '
                'current time and rain forecasts using radar data fetched '
                'online. Pretty neat! But how do you get these strips to show '
                'more than just a solid color (i.e. visual effects or '
                'animations), and actually use them as ‘dashboards’ in a '
                'scalable and maintainable way? In this project, I start out '
                'with a simple and robust (but not very powerful) solution, '
                'and end up with a ',
                ' over-engineered, but very flexible solution to this problem '
                'involving a custom programming language and bytecode '
                'instruction set.',
                'The recommended approach for controlling LED strips like this '
                'is by using ',
                '. ESPHome is a service that allows you to compile custom '
                'firmware for ESP8266, which can control LED strips (among '
                'many other things!) and allows for easy integration with ',
                '. The main benefit of ESPHome is easy device management: '
                'remote updating and reconfiguration is fully automated. '
                'Swapping out a broken ESP8266 or board is as easy as '
                'downloading the right firmware image from ESPHome, flashing '
                'it over USB, and swapping the hardware. The ESPHome firmware '
                'allows color and brightness to be set (from e.g. Home '
                'Assistant) for all LEDs at the same time. One way to make an '
                'LED strip into a more informative ‘dashboard’ would be to use '
                'a feature called ‘segments’ which allows separate colors to '
                'be set for different segments of the strip. Rudimentary, but '
                'very stable and easy to use.',
                'To show more than just contiguous blocks of different colors '
                'on a strip, we need a custom piece of software that can tell '
                'the LED strip what to show. Ideally we still use ESPHome and '
                'Home Assistant for control and provisioning. The ESPHome '
                'firmware allows for direct control of LED strips by '
                'third-party software through the ‘WLED’ feature. If you '
                'enable the ‘WLED’ effect for an LED strip (from Home '
                'Assistant), it will start listening for UDP packets that '
                'contain individual colors for the LEDs and show those! This '
                'means that all that is needed to show custom information is a '
                'computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi or even an ESP8266) somewhere '
                'in your network that broadcasts these UDP packets. ',
                'I wrote a very simple daemon in Rust that generates LED '
                '‘images’ with different contents (e.g. gradients, a ‘clock’ '
                'displayed as dots, or rain forecast data fetched from the '
                'Dutch ',
                '). This works quite brilliantly and also still allows me to '
                '‘switch off’ the intelligent dashboards and just show a solid '
                'color, or turn the strip off altogether, from Home '
                'Assistant. ',
                'The downside of this approach is that it doesn’t allow for '
                'any animations or visual effects; as the UDP packets are '
                'frequently dropped by my Wi-Fi network, sending packets '
                'faster than only a few frames per second leads to very '
                'glitchy results.',
                'Ideally, we would like to send short ‘animations’ or videos '
                'to the LED strip controller to play back. However, the '
                'controllers being ESP8266s have very little memory, making '
                'this infeasible rather quickly for longer LED strips: a strip '
                'that has 200 LEDs will require 600 bytes ',
                ' so even if we could use all of the user RAM available on the '
                'ESP, we could only store about 136 frames (or 2,2 seconds if '
                'running at 60 fps is desired). We can’t use the full RAM '
                'because (1) there is a whole Wi-Fi and TCP/IP stack to run, '
                'and (2) we need to be able to receive a packet while our '
                'previous ‘video’ is playing. This means at best we could '
                'store about half a second in this way.',
                'A more interesting approach would be to generate the effects '
                'on the controller itself. What if we could simply send it a '
                'script to execute? Something like this:',
                'As the ESP8266 is powerful enough to run e.g. Lua, this seems '
                'feasible. To show an animation where each LED is turned on in '
                'order to yellow, instead of sending 600 bytes * 200 frames = '
                '120 KiB of data, we can instead send a little program, which '
                'we could compile down to only a few bytes, containing a loop '
                'and a bit of logic. We could of course use Lua and be done '
                'with it, but the Lua interpreter is still quite heavy and, '
                'well, it is much more fun to make this yourself!',
                'First, I designed a very simple stack-based “instruction '
                'set”. Each instruction is a single byte, where the first ',
                ' (4 bits) determine the instruction type and the next nibble '
                'a variant. For instance, 0x0• means “POP byte from stack” '
                'where the last nibble determines the number of bytes to pop '
                '(conveniently making ‘0x00’ a no-operation). Similary, ‘0x11’ '
                'means ‘push a single byte’ (the byte to be pushed is the next '
                'byte in the code stream), 0x32 means ‘push the next 8 bytes '
                'as two integers’, et cetera. There are also operators (0x8• '
                'are binary operators, e.g. 0x80 is ‘add’ and 0x81 is '
                '‘subtract’) and jump instructions. Finally there are special '
                'instructions that push the length of the LED strip to the '
                'stack (0xe0 = get_length) and to set a pixel (0xe3 = '
                'set_pixel). ',
                'As an example, consider a simple program that loops from '
                '(get_length) down to zero:',
                'Next, I wrote a simple parser in Rust that could read a '
                'simple ‘programming language’ and compile it to the byte code '
                'just defined. For example, the program above can be written '
                'as:',
                'The equivalent of the example script above in this language '
                'would be the following:',
                'In the above, the ‘blit’ keyword tells the controller to send '
                'the LED strip ‘image’ created by the program (by calls to '
                'set_pixel) to the LED strip. The above program would '
                'effectively set all LEDs to yellow (RGB 255, 255, 0). The '
                'byte code for this program is as follows:',
                '17 bytes! (note that this works for strips of any length too. '
                'Nice.).',
                'Executing this code on an ESP8266 is very simply done using a '
                'for loop that iterates over the instructions, a giant switch '
                'statement that determines which instruction it is (based on '
                'the first nibble). The stack is simply an array of 32-bit '
                'integers with a separate value pointing at the last inserted '
                'item. Finally, there is a buffer for the LED data to be '
                'written to (by set_pixel). Even with this naive approach it '
                'is possible to reach a fairly high number of frames per '
                'second (of course depending on the amount of instructions '
                'that need to run between each frame). Currently this part is '
                'written in C++ using the Arduino toolkit, so it should be '
                'fairly easy to integrate it with ESPHome at some point.',

                'door to escape from poverty. Mastering coding or editing '

                'Latin American economies between 2003 and 2017. ',
                'The piracy rate is determined by the per capita usage of '

                'The overall conclusions based on those data are quite clear. '
                'Higher piracy levels are linked to less poverty. This effect '

                'model is controlled for other variables such as unemployment '
                'and health expenditure. This means that the hypothesis that '

                'rather short and there is no discussion section that '
                'elaborates on the findings. However, people should always be '
