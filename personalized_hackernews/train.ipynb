      ".Things have been falling out of the sky of late. Fortunately, no one has been hurt, but two recent space debris events offer a good reminder that what goes up often does come down..This past weekend, a huge Chinese rocket broke apart in the atmosphere above Southeast Asia, with large chunks of the 24-metric-ton booster .. Some of this debris fell within about 100 meters of a nearby village, but there have b\n",

      "In theory, it’s possible to create jet fuel from nothing more than water, CO2, and energy from the sun, but doing so outside of the laboratory has proved challenging. Now researchers have created the first fully-integrated system capable of doing it at scale in the field..Aviation accounts for around five percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and it’s proven stubbornly difficult to decarbonize.
